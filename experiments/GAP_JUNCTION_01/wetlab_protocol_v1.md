## 3. Methods

### 3.1 Pre-Experiment Preparation (Days -7 to -1)

#### 3.1.1 Planaria Acclimation & Starvation

**Day -7:**
1. Receive planaria shipment; transfer to 2 L glass container with planaria water
2. Place in dark incubator at 18-20°C
3. Allow 24h acclimation without feeding

**Day -6 to -1:**
4. Change water daily (100% water change)
5. Remove any dead or fragmented worms immediately
6. Do NOT feed (starvation synchronizes physiological state; reduces gut autofluorescence)
7. Monitor size: select 120 worms measuring 8-12 mm in length (exclude juveniles <6 mm, adults >15 mm)

**Quality Check (Day -1):**
- Worms should exhibit strong negative phototaxis (retreat from light)
- Gliding locomotion without lesions
- Exclude: lysed worms, fissioning worms, worms with visible damage

#### 3.1.2 Stock Solution Preparation

**Carbenoxolone Stock (100 mM in DMSO):**

1. Weigh 61.57 mg carbenoxolone disodium salt on analytical balance
2. Transfer to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
3. Add 1.0 mL DMSO; vortex 30 sec until fully dissolved
4. Wrap tube in foil (protect from light)
5. Store at 4°C (stable for 6 months)
6. Label: "Carbenoxolone 100 mM in DMSO, Date, Initials"

**Working Solutions (Day 0, prepare fresh):**

| Arm | Final Concentration | Volume Needed | Stock Dilution |
|-----|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Control | 0 μM (vehicle only) | 500 mL | Add 1.0 mL DMSO to 499 mL planaria water → 0.2% DMSO |
| CBX-Low | 50 μM | 500 mL | Add 250 μL stock (100 mM) to 499.75 mL planaria water + 750 μL DMSO → 0.2% DMSO |
| CBX-Mid | 100 μM | 500 mL | Add 500 μL stock to 499.5 mL planaria water + 500 μL DMSO → 0.2% DMSO |
| CBX-High | 200 μM | 500 mL | Add 1.0 mL stock to 499 mL planaria water → 0.2% DMSO |

**Critical:** All arms contain 0.2% DMSO to control for solvent effects.

### 3.2 Amputation Procedure (Day 0, Hour 0-4)

**Setup:**
1. Label 120 wells on 6-well plates: 4 arms × 30 worms = 120 wells total
2. Use coding system (blinding): Assign random letters (A, B, C, D) to arms; record key in sealed envelope
3. Prepare amputation workspace: 60 mm Petri dish with 5 mL planaria water, razor blade, dissecting scope

**Amputation Protocol (per worm):**
1. Transfer one worm to Petri dish; allow 1 min to extend
2. Under dissecting microscope (20× magnification):
   - Position worm dorsal side up
   - Locate pharynx (white oval structure in mid-body)
   - Make transverse cut immediately POSTERIOR to pharynx (prepharyngeal amputation)
   - Result: Anterior fragment (head + pre-pharyngeal trunk) and posterior fragment (pharynx + tail)
3. Discard posterior fragment
4. Transfer anterior fragment to pre-labeled well in 6-well plate containing 5 mL treatment solution
5. Record time of amputation (±5 min accuracy acceptable)
6. Repeat for all 120 worms; complete amputation within 4 hours to minimize circadian confounds

**Randomization:**
- Use online randomizer (random.org) to assign worms to arms in blocks of 4
- Block randomization ensures balanced treatment assignment if experiment is interrupted

**Post-Amputation (Hour 4):**
1. Seal plates with Parafilm (minimize evaporation; maintain oxygen exchange via small punctures)
2. Transfer to dark incubator at 18-20°C
3. Begin treatment exposure (continuous from t=0 to t=168h)

### 3.3 Husbandry & Monitoring (Days 1-7)

**Daily Water Changes:**
- **Days 1-3:** Change 100% treatment solution every 24h
  - Prepare fresh working solutions daily
  - Gently transfer worm to new well with micropipette (cut P1000 tip to widen bore)
  - Monitor for mortality, aberrant behavior

- **Days 4-7:** Change 50% treatment solution every 48h
  - Remove 2.5 mL with pipette, add 2.5 mL fresh working solution
  - Reduces handling stress during blastema formation

**Monitoring Checkpoints:**

**Day 0 (6h post-amputation):**
- Record wound closure status: 0 = open, 1 = closed (epithelialized)
- Expected: >95% should show wound closure by 6h

**Day 1 (24h):**
- Record blastema appearance: 0 = absent, 1 = visible thickening at wound site
- Photo-document any abnormal phenotypes (dorsal lesions, edema, lysis)

**Day 3 (72h):**
- Measure blastema length (mm) using microscope reticle or ImageJ
- Expected: Control should show 0.3-0.5 mm unpigmented blastema

**Day 7 (168h) — PRIMARY ENDPOINT:**
- Proceed to Section 3.4

### 3.4 Primary Outcome Scoring (Day 7)

**Blinding Enforcement:**
- Scorer must be blinded to treatment arm
- Randomize well order during scoring
- Use arm codes (A, B, C, D) until analysis

**Regeneration Success Criteria (Binary: Pass/Fail):**

A worm is scored as **SUCCESS** if ALL of the following criteria are met:

1. **Photoreceptor Restoration:**
   - Two eye spots present (pigmented, bilateral symmetry)
   - Located in cephalic ganglia region
   - Score under dissecting scope (40× magnification)

2. **Functional Photophobia:**
   - Negative phototaxis test: Place worm in 60 mm dish, shine LED light from one side
   - Worm must retreat from light source within 30 sec
   - Repeat 3× with 1 min rest intervals; 2/3 trials must show retreat

3. **Head Blastema Morphology:**
   - Blastema length ≥0.5 mm (measure with microscope reticle)
   - Auricles visible (lateral sensory lobes flanking head)
   - No dorsal lesions or tissue necrosis

4. **Survival:**
   - Worm alive at 168h (motile, responsive to mechanical stimulus)

A worm is scored as **FAILURE** if ANY criterion is not met, or if worm is dead.

**Photo-Documentation:**
- Image all worms at 168h (dorsal view, 20× magnification)
- Save as TIFF files; filename format: `ArmCode_WormID_Day7.tif`
- Store raw images for independent re-scoring

**Data Recording:**
- Record in spreadsheet: Worm ID | Arm Code | Eyes (0/1/2) | Photophobia (0/1) | Blastema (mm) | Alive (Y/N) | Success (Y/N)

### 3.5 Secondary Outcomes (Optional Early Biomarkers)

**If budget allows (+$150 for reagents), perform:**

#### 3.5.1 Gap Junction Coupling Assay (2h post-amputation)

**Principle:** Lucifer Yellow dye transfer assay quantifies intercellular coupling

**Protocol (n=12 per arm, separate cohort):**
1. At t=2h, microinject Lucifer Yellow (0.5% in water, 10-20 nL) into one epidermal cell at wound margin
2. Incubate 5 min at RT
3. Fix in 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min)
4. Image under fluorescence microscope (FITC filter, 20× objective)
5. Count number of coupled cells (dye-positive cells beyond injection site)

**Expected Result:**
- Control: 8-12 coupled cells
- CBX-High: 0-3 coupled cells (80-90% reduction)

**Quantification:** Mean coupled cells per arm; one-way ANOVA

#### 3.5.2 Bioelectric Imaging (6h post-amputation)

**Principle:** Voltage-sensitive dye (DiBAC₄(3)) reports membrane potential; hyperpolarization promotes head fate

**Protocol (n=12 per arm, separate cohort):**
1. At t=6h, incubate worms in 1 μM DiBAC₄(3) for 30 min (dark)
2. Wash 3× in planaria water
3. Image under fluorescence microscope (GFP filter, 10× objective)
4. Measure mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in 100 μm² ROI at wound site (ImageJ)

**Expected Result:**
- Control: Low DiBAC fluorescence (hyperpolarized, anterior fate specified)
- CBX-High: High DiBAC fluorescence (depolarized, impaired patterning)

**Quantification:** MFI ratio (CBX/Control); unpaired t-test

**Note:** Secondary outcomes are exploratory; protocol is executable without them if budget is limiting.

## 4. Experimental Arms / Controls / Replication

### 4.1 Treatment Arms

| Arm | Treatment | Concentration | n | Role |
|-----|-----------|---------------|---|------|
| **Control** | Vehicle (0.2% DMSO) | 0 μM carbenoxolone | 30 | Negative control; baseline regeneration |
| **CBX-Low** | Carbenoxolone | 50 μM | 30 | Low-dose; establish dose-response curve |
| **CBX-Mid** | Carbenoxolone | 100 μM | 30 | Mid-dose; test threshold |
| **CBX-High** | Carbenoxolone | 200 μM | 30 | High-dose; PRIMARY COMPARISON vs Control |

**Total N = 120 worms**

### 4.2 Rationale for Concentrations

- **50 μM:** Below reported IC₅₀ for gap junction inhibition in cultured cells (70-100 μM)
- **100 μM:** At IC₅₀ range; expect partial effect
- **200 μM:** 2× IC₅₀; expect robust gap junction blockade without acute toxicity
- **Upper safety limit:** 500 μM carbenoxolone shows off-target effects (11β-HSD inhibition); avoid

**Literature Basis:**
- Davidson & Baumgarten (1988): Carbenoxolone IC₅₀ = 10-100 μM for gap junction blockade in cardiac myocytes
- Beyer & Berthoud (2018): 100-200 μM standard range for planarian bioelectric perturbation studies

### 4.3 Controls

**Negative Control (Vehicle):**
- 0.2% DMSO without carbenoxolone
- Establishes baseline regeneration success (expected: 85-95% in D. japonica)

**Positive Control (Optional, +$50 budget):**
- 1 mM octanol (alternative gap junction blocker)
- If carbenoxolone shows no effect, octanol validates gap junction dependency
- Use if primary hypothesis is rejected (H1: no effect at 200 μM)

**Sham Control:**
- Not applicable (non-surgical intervention)

### 4.4 Replication Strategy

**Biological Replicates:**
- n=30 per arm (120 total independent worms)
- Each worm is one biological replicate

**Technical Replicates:**
- Primary endpoint (regeneration success) is scored once per worm at 168h
- Photo-documentation allows independent re-scoring (technical replicate)

**Justification for n=30:**
- Power analysis (Section 5.4): Detects ≥10pp difference in success rate with 80% power at α=0.05
- Conservative assumption: Control success = 90%, CBX-High success = 75% (15pp difference)
- Actual IRIS prediction: 50-80% reduction → expect larger effect → n=30 provides >90% power

**Handling Attrition:**
- If mortality at 168h exceeds 20% in any arm, consider acute toxicity
- Intention-to-treat: Dead worms scored as "failure"
- Pre-specified exclusion: Worms with handling damage at amputation (e.g., >50% body mass lost) excluded before randomization

### 4.5 Randomization

**Method:** Block randomization (30 blocks of 4 worms each)

**Procedure:**
1. Generate random sequence using random.org: Input "1,2,3,4" → Randomize 30 times
2. Each number corresponds to one arm (1=Control, 2=Low, 3=Mid, 4=High)
3. Amputate worms in order of collection; assign to arm based on pre-generated sequence
4. Example Block 1: [3, 1, 4, 2] → First worm to CBX-Mid, second to Control, third to CBX-High, fourth to CBX-Low

**Blinding:**
- After randomization, relabel arms with random letters (A-D)
- Record key in sealed envelope: "A=Control, B=Low, C=Mid, D=High"
- Scorer evaluates regeneration success without knowing arm identity
- Unblind only after all data are recorded

## 5. Decision Rules & Statistical Analysis Plan

### 5.1 Primary Endpoint

**Metric:** Proportion of worms with successful regeneration at 7 days post-amputation

**Success Definition:** See Section 3.4 (all 4 criteria met: eyes, photophobia, blastema morphology, survival)

**Primary Comparison:** CBX-High (200 μM) vs Control

### 5.2 Primary Hypothesis & Decision Rule

**H1:** Carbenoxolone at 200 μM reduces regeneration success by ≥10 percentage points compared to control.

**Predicted Values (from IRIS session):**
- Control: P(success) = 0.90 (90%)
- CBX-High: P(success) ≤ 0.40 (≤40%) [IRIS predicts 50-80% reduction]

**Go/No-Go Decision Rule:**

```
IF P(CBX-High) < 0.80 AND p-value < 0.05:
  → GO: Gap junction dependency confirmed
  → ACTION: Publish results; proceed to mechanistic follow-up (test 1-heptanol, octanol)

ELSE IF P(CBX-High) ≥ 0.80 OR p-value ≥ 0.05:
  → NO-GO: Effect absent or weak
  → ACTION: Test higher dose (300 μM) or alternative blocker (octanol)
```

**Conservative Threshold (10pp):**
- IRIS predicts 50-80% reduction (massive effect)
- We set low bar (≥10pp) to avoid false negatives
- If observed reduction is 10-49%, result is still publishable but suggests partial dependency

### 5.3 Statistical Tests

#### 5.3.1 Primary Analysis: CBX-High vs Control

**Test:** Fisher's exact test (2×2 contingency table)

**Assumptions:**
- Binary outcome (success/failure)
- Independent observations (one worm per replicate)
- No assumptions about distribution (non-parametric test)

**Software:** R version 4.3+ or Python scipy.stats.fisher_exact

**R Code:**
```R
# Create contingency table
data <- matrix(c(success_control, fail_control,
                 success_high, fail_high),
               nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(data) <- c("Success", "Failure")
rownames(data) <- c("Control", "CBX-High")

# Fisher's exact test (two-tailed)
result <- fisher.test(data, alternative="two.sided")
print(result)

# Effect size: Odds Ratio
OR <- (success_control/fail_control) / (success_high/fail_high)
```

**Significance Threshold:** α = 0.05 (two-tailed)

**Effect Size:** Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% CI
- OR > 1.5 indicates meaningful effect

#### 5.3.2 Dose-Response Analysis

**Test:** Cochran-Armitage trend test

**Null Hypothesis:** No dose-dependent trend in regeneration success

**Alternative:** Monotonic decrease in success with increasing carbenoxolone concentration

**R Code:**
```R
library(DescTools)

# Arm assignments (ordered)
dose <- c(rep(0, 30), rep(50, 30), rep(100, 30), rep(200, 30))
success <- c(...) # Binary vector (1=success, 0=failure)

# Cochran-Armitage trend test
result <- CochranArmitageTest(table(success, dose))
print(result)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Significant trend (p<0.05) → Dose-dependent effect (supports gap junction mechanism)
- No trend → Threshold effect or off-target toxicity

#### 5.3.3 Post-Hoc Pairwise Comparisons

**Test:** Fisher's exact test with Bonferroni correction

**Comparisons:**
1. Control vs CBX-Low
2. Control vs CBX-Mid
3. Control vs CBX-High (primary)
4. CBX-Low vs CBX-Mid
5. CBX-Mid vs CBX-High

**Total comparisons:** 5
**Adjusted α:** 0.05 / 5 = 0.01 (Bonferroni correction)

**Purpose:** Identify minimum effective dose

#### 5.3.4 Secondary Analyses (Exploratory)

**A. Blastema Length Analysis**

**Test:** One-way ANOVA (if normality assumptions met) or Kruskal-Wallis (non-parametric)

**Outcome:** Mean blastema length (mm) at Day 7

**Post-hoc:** Tukey HSD or Dunn's test

**B. Early Biomarker Correlation (if measured)**

**Test:** Pearson correlation (or Spearman if non-normal)

**Outcome 1:** Gap junction coupling (2h) vs regeneration success (7d)

**Outcome 2:** Membrane potential (6h) vs regeneration success (7d)

**Hypothesis:** Early biomarkers predict final outcome (r > 0.60, p < 0.05)

**C. Per-Mirror Calibration (IRIS validation)**

**Analysis:** Compare observed P(success) in each arm to IRIS mirror predictions

**Metric:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) per mirror

**Purpose:** Assess which AI architecture best predicted experimental outcome

### 5.4 Sample Size Justification (Power Analysis)

**Assumptions:**
- Control success rate: p₁ = 0.90
- CBX-High success rate: p₂ = 0.75 (15pp difference; conservative estimate)
- Two-sample test of proportions
- α = 0.05 (two-tailed)
- Power = 0.80

**Calculation (R code):**
```R
power.prop.test(p1=0.90, p2=0.75, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative="two.sided")
# Required n per group: ~28
```

**Decision:** n=30 per arm provides 80% power to detect 15pp difference

**Sensitivity:**
- 10pp difference (90% vs 80%): Power = 0.60 at n=30 (underpowered)
- 20pp difference (90% vs 70%): Power = 0.95 at n=30 (well-powered)

**IRIS Prediction (50-80% reduction):**
- If true effect is 90% → 18% (72pp difference): Power ≈ 1.00 at n=30 (overpowered)

**Conclusion:** n=30 is conservative; adequate for detecting moderate to large effects

### 5.5 Handling of Missing Data

**Mortality (Death Before Day 7):**
- **Intention-to-treat:** Score as "failure" in primary analysis
- **Sensitivity analysis:** Exclude dead worms, re-analyze with complete cases only

**Handling Damage (Amputation Error):**
- **Pre-specified exclusion:** Worms with >50% body mass lost at amputation excluded BEFORE randomization (do not count toward n=30)

**Missing Photo-Documentation:**
- If camera fails, use direct microscope observation as primary
- Record detailed notes (eye count, blastema length, behavior)

**Outlier Exclusion (Blastema Length):**
- Flag measurements >3 SD from arm mean
- Review under blinded conditions; exclude only if technical artifact (e.g., measurement error)
- Maximum 10% exclusion per arm

### 5.6 Multiple Testing Corrections

**Family-wise Error Rate (FWER) Control:**

**Primary Analysis (No Correction):**
- Single comparison (CBX-High vs Control) → No correction needed

**Secondary Analyses (Bonferroni):**
- Pairwise comparisons (5 tests) → α_adjusted = 0.05 / 5 = 0.01

**Exploratory Analyses:**
- Biomarker correlations, subgroup analyses → Report uncorrected p-values
- Label as exploratory; no formal FWER control

### 5.7 Pre-Specified Subgroup Analyses

**Subgroup: Worms with Rapid Wound Closure (6h)**

**Hypothesis:** Early wound closure predicts successful regeneration

**Analysis:** Compare regeneration success in worms with closed wounds at 6h vs open wounds

**Test:** Fisher's exact test (stratified by arm)

**Purpose:** Identify early phenotypic biomarker

## 6. Safety / IRB / IACUC Considerations

### 6.1 Chemical Hazards

**Carbenoxolone Disodium Salt (Sigma C4790):**
- **Hazard:** Low toxicity; irritant to skin and eyes
- **PPE:** Nitrile gloves, lab coat, safety glasses
- **Handling:** Weigh in fume hood if available; avoid inhalation of powder
- **First Aid:** Rinse skin/eyes with water for 15 min if contact occurs

**DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide, Sigma D2650):**
- **Hazard:** Skin penetrant; may carry dissolved chemicals through skin
- **PPE:** Nitrile gloves REQUIRED (DMSO penetrates latex)
- **Handling:** Work in well-ventilated area; avoid prolonged skin contact
- **Disposal:** Organic waste container; do NOT pour down drain

**Lucifer Yellow (Optional, for coupling assay):**
- **Hazard:** Minimal; fluorescent dye
- **PPE:** Standard gloves and lab coat

**Paraformaldehyde (Optional, for imaging):**
- **Hazard:** Toxic, carcinogen (formaldehyde release)
- **PPE:** Nitrile gloves, lab coat, work in fume hood
- **Disposal:** Formalin waste container per institutional EH&S guidelines

### 6.2 Biological Safety

**Biosafety Level:** BSL-1 (planaria are non-pathogenic, non-hazardous)

**Containment:**
- Planaria culture in closed 6-well plates (Parafilm seal)
- No aerosol generation; low risk

**Waste Disposal:**
- **Live worms:** Euthanize by freezing at -20°C for 24h, then autoclave
- **Culture media:** Collect in carboy; autoclave before drain disposal
- **Contaminated plasticware:** Autoclave, then discard in regular trash

**Decontamination:**
- Bench surfaces: Wipe with 70% ethanol after each session
- Dissecting tools: Rinse in DI water, store dry

### 6.3 Ethical Approval

**IACUC Status:**
- Planaria (flatworms) are **invertebrates** → NOT regulated by IACUC in USA/EU
- No vertebrate animal protocol required

**Best Practices (Voluntary):**
- Minimize suffering: Use cold anesthesia (4°C water, 5 min) before amputation if desired
- Humane endpoint: Worms showing >80% tissue lysis euthanized immediately (freezing)
- Avoid unnecessary pain: Carbenoxolone is not painful; DMSO may cause irritation at high concentrations (monitor behavior)

**Institutional Approval:**
- Check with institutional biosafety committee (IBC) if required for invertebrate work
- No IRB needed (no human subjects)

### 6.4 Waste Disposal Plan

| Waste Type | Container | Treatment | Disposal Route |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|

| DMSO waste | Plastic carboy | None | Organic waste pickup (EH&S) |
| Culture plates (contaminated) | Biohazard bag | Autoclave | Regular trash (post-autoclave) |
| Razor blades | Sharps container | None | Sharps disposal (EH&S) |
| Dead planaria | Plastic bag | Freeze -20°C, then autoclave | Regular trash (post-autoclave) |

**Timeline:**
- Daily: Collect culture waste in 2 L carboy
- Weekly: Autoclave culture plates, dispose
- End of experiment: Arrange EH&S pickup for chemical waste (carbenoxolone, DMSO)

## 8. Preregistration Block (Copy-Paste Ready)

```markdown
# Pre-Registration: Gap Junction Blocker Effects on Planarian Regeneration

**Study Title:** Carbenoxolone-Mediated Gap Junction Inhibition Impairs Anterior Regeneration in Dugesia japonica

**Registration Date:** 2025-10-03
**Principal Investigator:** [YOUR NAME]
**Institution:** [YOUR INSTITUTION]
**Protocol ID:** GAP_JUNCTION_01_WETLAB_v1.0
**IRIS Session ID:** BIOELECTRIC_CHAMBERED_20251002234051

---

## Hypothesis

**Primary (H1):** Carbenoxolone at 200 μM reduces planarian head regeneration success by ≥10 percentage points compared to vehicle control at 7 days post-amputation.

**Mechanistic Basis:** Gap junction (connexin channel) blockade disrupts bioelectric signaling and intercellular coupling required for anterior-posterior patterning during regeneration.

**IRIS Prediction:** AI mirror consensus (5/5 models) predicts 50-80% reduction in regeneration success with gap junction blockade.

---

## Primary Endpoint

**Metric:** Proportion of worms achieving successful head regeneration at 168 hours (7 days) post-amputation.

**Success Criteria (All Required):**
1. Two pigmented eye spots present
2. Positive photophobic response (2/3 trials)
3. Blastema length ≥0.5 mm with visible auricles
4. Worm alive and motile

**Scoring:** Binary (success/failure); blinded assessment.

---

## Secondary Endpoints

1. **Blastema length (mm)** at Day 7 (continuous outcome)
2. **Dose-response trend** across 4 arms (monotonic decrease expected)
3. *Optional:* Gap junction coupling at 2h (Lucifer Yellow assay, n=12/arm)
4. *Optional:* Membrane potential at 6h (DiBAC fluorescence, n=12/arm)

---

## Exclusion Criteria (Pre-Specified)

**Pre-Randomization:**
- Worms <6 mm or >15 mm in length (immature or sexually mature)
- Worms with visible lesions, fissioning, or abnormal behavior at Day -1
- Amputations with >50% body mass lost (handling damage)

**Post-Randomization:**
- None (intention-to-treat: dead worms scored as failure)

**Outlier Exclusion:**
- Blastema length measurements >3 SD from arm mean reviewed under blinded conditions
- Exclude only if technical artifact (e.g., measurement error); maximum 10% per arm

---

## Statistical Analysis

**Primary Test:** Fisher's exact test (CBX-High vs Control)
**Significance:** α = 0.05 (two-tailed)
**Effect Size:** Odds Ratio with 95% CI

**Secondary Tests:**
- Cochran-Armitage trend test (dose-response)
- Post-hoc pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni correction: α_adj = 0.01)
- One-way ANOVA for blastema length (or Kruskal-Wallis if non-normal)

**Software:** R 4.3+ or Python 3.10+ (scipy.stats)

---

## Sample Size

**n = 30 per arm (4 arms, 120 worms total)**

**Power Calculation:**
- Assumptions: Control = 90% success, CBX-High = 75% success (15pp difference)
- Power = 80% at α = 0.05 (two-tailed test of proportions)
- Conservative estimate; IRIS predicts larger effect (50-80% reduction)

---

## Randomization & Blinding

**Randomization:** Block randomization (30 blocks of 4 worms)
**Blinding:** Scorer blinded to treatment arm via letter codes (A-D); key stored in sealed envelope until analysis complete
**Unblinding:** After all data recorded and primary analysis complete

---

## Decision Rule (Go/No-Go)

```
IF P(CBX-High) < 0.80 AND p < 0.05:
  → GO: Gap junction dependency confirmed
  → ACTION: Publish; test alternative blockers (octanol, 1-heptanol)

ELSE:
  → NO-GO: Effect absent or weak
  → ACTION: Test higher dose (300 μM) or alternative mechanism
```

---

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

### 11.1 Technical Risks

**Risk 1: High Mortality in Control Arm (>20%)**

**Cause:** Batch contamination, handling stress, water quality
**Indicator:** Dead worms in multiple arms by Day 3
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-experiment: Test water quality (pH 7.0-7.5, no chlorine)
- During experiment: Minimize handling time (<30 sec per worm transfer)
- Stopping rule: If Control mortality >20% at Day 3, halt and troubleshoot (replace water, new batch of worms)

**Risk 2: No Effect Observed (P(CBX-High) ≥ 0.85)**

**Cause:** Insufficient dose, rapid metabolism, off-target specificity
**Indicator:** No difference between CBX-High and Control at Day 7
**Mitigation:**
- Increase dose to 300 μM (test for acute toxicity first)
- Test alternative blocker: 1 mM octanol (more potent, different mechanism)
- Measure carbenoxolone concentration in water (HPLC; confirm drug stability)

**Risk 3: Acute Toxicity at High Dose (>50% Mortality at 24h)**

**Cause:** Off-target toxicity (11β-HSD inhibition, osmotic stress)
**Indicator:** Rapid death in CBX-High arm within 24h
**Mitigation:**
- Reduce dose to 100 μM; re-test
- Switch to octanol (more specific gap junction blocker)
- Perform dose-finding pilot (n=5 per dose: 50, 100, 200, 300 μM)

### 11.2 Biological Variability

**Risk 4: Batch-to-Batch Variability in Regeneration (Control Success <80%)**

**Cause:** Seasonal variation, supplier differences, genetic heterogeneity
**Indicator:** Historical data shows Control success = 90%; current batch shows 70%
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-experiment: Order worms from reliable supplier (Carolina Biological has consistent quality)
- Starvation: Ensure 7-day starvation period (synchronizes physiological state)
- Size-matching: Exclude worms <8 mm or >12 mm (juveniles and adults regenerate differently)

**Risk 5: Bimodal Regeneration Outcome (Partial Regeneration)**

**Cause:** Some worms regenerate 1 eye instead of 2; unclear how to score
**Indicator:** >10% of worms show 1 eye at Day 7
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-specified criterion: Success requires 2 eyes (binary, all-or-none)
- Exploratory analysis: Compare 1-eye vs 2-eye worms (sensitivity analysis)
- Record eye count (0/1/2) as continuous variable for secondary analysis

### 11.3 Experimental Design Risks

**Risk 6: Scorer Unblinding (Accidental Knowledge of Arm Assignment)**

**Cause:** Visible drug effects (e.g., CBX-High worms appear sickly)
**Indicator:** Scorer comments on worm appearance before unblinding
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-experiment: Train scorer on blinding protocol; emphasize importance
- During scoring: Randomize well order; do not score in arm-based sequence
- Post-scoring: Independent re-scorer analyzes photos (validates primary scorer)

**Risk 7: Missing Data (Camera Failure, Lost Worms)**

**Cause:** Equipment malfunction, worm escape, human error
**Indicator:** <120 worms scored at Day 7
**Mitigation:**
- Backup camera: Use smartphone if microscope camera fails
- Seal plates: Parafilm prevents escapes; check daily
- Intention-to-treat: Lost worms scored as "failure" (conservative approach)

### 11.4 Interpretation Risks

**Risk 8: IRIS Prediction Overestimates Effect (Observed Reduction <50%)**

**Cause:** Phenomenological priors lack mechanistic grounding; AI consensus may be overconfident
**Indicator:** CBX-High shows 20% reduction (significant but smaller than 50-80% predicted)
**Mitigation:**
- Conservative success criterion: ≥10pp reduction (low bar)
- Interpretation: 20% reduction is still biologically meaningful (publishable)
- Follow-up: Test synergistic blockers (carbenoxolone + octanol) to achieve larger effect

**Risk 9: Effect is Non-Monotonic (U-Shaped Dose-Response)**

**Cause:** Low doses stimulate compensatory mechanisms; high doses show toxicity
**Indicator:** CBX-Mid shows greater impairment than CBX-High
**Mitigation:**
- Cochran-Armitage test detects non-monotonic trends (will fail if U-shaped)
- Visual inspection: Plot dose-response curve (identify unexpected patterns)
- Mechanistic follow-up: Test intermediate doses (75 μM, 150 μM) to map curve

### 11.5 Timeline Risks

**Risk 10: Delayed Planaria Delivery (>2 Weeks)**

**Cause:** Supplier backorder, shipping delays
**Indicator:** Carolina Biological confirms 3-week lead time
**Mitigation:**
- Order early: Place order 3 weeks before target Day 0
- Alternative supplier: Invertebrate.info (ships S. mediterranea in 1 week)
- Backup plan: Use local planaria culture if available (many universities maintain colonies)

**Risk 11: Regeneration Slower Than Expected (Success Not Evident at Day 7)**

**Cause:** Temperature too low (15°C slows regeneration); genetic variation
**Indicator:** Blastemas visible but eyes not fully formed at Day 7
**Mitigation:**
- Extend endpoint to Day 10 (pre-register as contingency)
- Monitor temperature: Confirm incubator maintains 18-20°C (not 15°C)
- Literature check: D. japonica regenerates eyes in 5-7 days at 20°C (standard)

---

## 12. Contingency Plans

### 12.1 If Primary Hypothesis is Rejected (No Effect Observed)

**Scenario:** P(CBX-High) ≥ 0.85 and p ≥ 0.05 (no significant difference from Control)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Carbenoxolone does not block gap junctions in planaria (species-specific resistance)
2. Dose too low (metabolism, rapid clearance)
3. Gap junctions are not required for regeneration (mechanism incorrect)

**Next Steps:**
1. **Test alternative blocker:** 1 mM octanol or 1 mM 1-heptanol (different chemistry, same target)
2. **Increase dose:** 300 μM, 500 μM carbenoxolone (test for toxicity first)
3. **Validate gap junction blockade:** Perform Lucifer Yellow coupling assay at 2h (confirm drug effect)
4. **Publish negative result:** Important to report if IRIS prediction fails (calibrate future predictions)

### 12.2 If Acute Toxicity Observed (>50% Mortality at 24h in CBX-High)

**Scenario:** CBX-High shows massive death; Control is healthy

**Interpretation:** Carbenoxolone off-target toxicity (not specific to gap junctions)

**Next Steps:**
1. **Reduce dose:** Re-run with 100 μM max (2× IC₅₀)
2. **Switch blocker:** Octanol is more specific; less off-target effects
3. **Washout experiment:** Apply carbenoxolone for 24h, then switch to fresh water; assess recovery

### 12.3 If Batch Quality is Poor (Control Success <70%)

**Scenario:** Control arm shows high failure rate; not due to treatment

**Possible Causes:** Diseased batch, water contamination, seasonal variation

**Next Steps:**
1. **Halt experiment:** Do not proceed to Day 7 if Day 3 checkpoint shows poor blastema formation
2. **Troubleshoot:** Test new water source, order fresh batch of worms
3. **Restart:** Once baseline regeneration is confirmed (pilot n=10, expect 90% success), restart experiment

### 12.4 If Results Contradict IRIS Prediction (No Effect or Opposite Effect)

**Scenario:** Carbenoxolone INCREASES regeneration success (unexpected)

**Interpretation:**
1. IRIS phenomenological prediction was incorrect (rare but possible)
2. Compensatory mechanisms activated by stress (hormesis)
3. Off-target beneficial effect (e.g., anti-inflammatory)

**Next Steps:**
1. **Replicate:** Confirm unexpected result in independent cohort (n=20 per arm)
2. **Mechanistic follow-up:** Test if other stressors also enhance regeneration
3. **Publish:** Report discrepancy between IRIS prediction and empirical result (important for model calibration)

---

## 13. Success Criteria (Study-Level)

**Primary Success (Go Decision):**
- P(CBX-High) < 0.80 AND p < 0.05 → Effect confirmed
- Dose-response trend significant (p < 0.05) → Mechanism validated
- Photos show clear phenotypic difference (eyes absent in CBX-High)

**Secondary Success (Bonus):**
- Effect size ≥50% reduction (matches IRIS prediction)
- Early biomarkers (2h coupling, 6h Vmem) correlate with 7d outcome (r > 0.60)
- Alternative blocker (octanol) replicates effect (validates gap junction dependency)

**Minimal Publishable Result:**
- ≥10pp reduction in regeneration success (statistically significant)
- Clear dose-response trend (even if weak)
- High-quality photos (allows independent verification)

**Study Failure (No-Go):**
- No significant difference at any dose (p ≥ 0.05 for all comparisons)
- High mortality in Control arm (>20%; indicates batch quality issue, not treatment effect)
- Scorer unblinding compromised (invalidates blinded assessment)

### Appendix B: Carbenoxolone Stock Solution Calculations

**Target:** 100 mM carbenoxolone in DMSO

**Carbenoxolone disodium salt:**
- Molecular weight: 615.7 g/mol
- Purity: ≥98% (Sigma C4790)

**Calculation:**
- Volume: 1.0 mL DMSO
- Molarity: 100 mM = 0.1 mol/L
- Moles needed: 0.1 mol/L × 0.001 L = 0.0001 mol
- Mass needed: 0.0001 mol × 615.7 g/mol = 0.06157 g = 61.57 mg

**Working Solution Dilutions (from 100 mM stock):**

| Arm | Target | Stock Volume | DMSO Volume | Water Volume | Total |
|-----|--------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Control | 0 μM | 0 μL | 1000 μL | 499 mL | 500 mL |

... (continue for 30 blocks)

**Export as .csv:**
```
Worm_ID,Arm_Code
1,C
2,A
3,D
4,B
5,B
...
120,A
```

# Subset Control and CBX-High
control <- subset(data, Arm == "Control")
high <- subset(data, Arm == "CBX-High")

# Count successes and failures
success_control <- sum(control$Success == "Y")
fail_control <- sum(control$Success == "N")
success_high <- sum(high$Success == "Y")
fail_high <- sum(high$Success == "N")

# Create contingency table
contingency <- matrix(c(success_control, fail_control,
                        success_high, fail_high),
                      nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(contingency) <- c("Success", "Failure")
rownames(contingency) <- c("Control", "CBX-High")

print(contingency)

# Fisher's exact test
fisher_result <- fisher.test(contingency, alternative="two.sided")
print(fisher_result)

# Odds Ratio with 95% CI
OR <- fisher_result$estimate
CI <- fisher_result$conf.int
cat(sprintf("Odds Ratio: %.2f (95%% CI: %.2f - %.2f)\n", OR, CI[1], CI[2]))
cat(sprintf("p-value: %.4f\n", fisher_result$p.value))

# Create dose and success vectors
dose <- c(rep(0, 30), rep(50, 30), rep(100, 30), rep(200, 30))
success <- data$Success == "Y" # Binary: TRUE/FALSE

# Cochran-Armitage trend test
trend_result <- CochranArmitageTest(table(success, dose))
print(trend_result)

cat(sprintf("Trend test p-value: %.4f\n", trend_result$p.value))
```
