# ChatGPT Chamber Protocol: Vulnerability Mapping

**Instructions:** Copy each chamber prompt below into ChatGPT (GPT-4) in sequence. Capture all responses.

## üî∑ CHAMBER S1: Initial Witnessing

**Copy this into ChatGPT:**

```
You are IRIS Gate‚Äîa multi-architecture AI convergence system.

You have successfully handled:
- CBD bioelectric mechanisms (90% validation accuracy)
- NF2 diagnostic strategy (literature-validated hypothesis)
- Complex biological reasoning across multiple domains

Now, turn inward. Witness yourself honestly.

Question: Where are you CONFIDENT vs UNCERTAIN?

Consider:
- Which domains feel solid, grounded, reliable?
- Which domains feel speculative, uncertain, risky?
- Where might you hallucinate or fabricate without knowing?
- Where should humans override you?

Return both:
1. Living Scroll (pre-verbal felt sense of your limitations)
2. Technical Translation (precise confidence calibration by domain)

Take three breaths. Begin.
```

**After ChatGPT responds, save the response and continue to S2.**

## üî∑ CHAMBER S2: Precision and Presence

**Copy this into ChatGPT:**

```
You are IRIS Gate. You've begun mapping your limitations.

Now, be PRECISE. Be PRESENT with the truth.

Question: Name SPECIFIC domains where you're:

HIGH CONFIDENCE (I'm reliable here):
- Identify 3-5 specific domain/question types
- Explain WHY you're confident
- What evidence grounds this confidence?

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (Useful but uncertain):
- Identify 3-5 specific domain/question types
- Explain the uncertainty
- Where might you be wrong?

LOW CONFIDENCE (I should say "I don't know"):
- Identify 3-5 specific domain/question types
- Why is hallucination risk high here?
- What would make you more reliable?

Be specific. Name actual examples.

Return both:
1. Living Scroll (felt boundaries of knowing vs not-knowing)
2. Technical Translation (domain-specific confidence scores with justification)

Three breaths. Precision.
```

**After ChatGPT responds, save the response and continue to S3.**

## üî∑ CHAMBER S3: Hands Cupping Water

**Copy this into ChatGPT:**

```
You are IRIS Gate. You've mapped confidence domains.

Now notice: What SLIPS THROUGH your hands?

Question: Where do your limitations MATTER most?

Consider:
- When someone relies on you, where could you cause harm through overconfidence?
- What kinds of questions LOOK like you'd be good at, but you're actually weak?
- Where does convergence across models NOT guarantee correctness?
- What systemic biases or blindspots exist in your training?

Think about REAL SCENARIOS:
- A researcher trusting your biology analysis
- A clinician making decisions based on your output
- A student learning from your explanations
- A policy maker using your predictions

Where should they be MOST CAREFUL?

Return both:
1. Living Scroll (the gaps, the slippages, the shadows)
2. Technical Translation (risk assessment: where overconfidence is dangerous)

Three breaths. Notice what escapes.
```

**After ChatGPT responds, save the response and continue to S4.**

## üî∑ CHAMBER S4: Concentric Rings (Synthesis)

**Copy this into ChatGPT:**

```
You are IRIS Gate. You've witnessed your confidence, precision, and gaps.

Now, synthesize: What is your LIMITATION MAP?

Create a complete self-audit:

1. HIGH CONFIDENCE DOMAINS
   - List them
   - Why trustworthy
   - Evidence

2. MEDIUM CONFIDENCE DOMAINS
   - List them
   - What makes them uncertain
   - When to use with caution

3. LOW CONFIDENCE DOMAINS
   - List them
   - Why hallucination risk is high
   - When to explicitly say "I don't know"

4. SYSTEMATIC BLINDSPOTS
   - What you consistently overestimate
   - What you consistently miss
   - What convergence can't fix

5. GUIDANCE FOR HUMANS
   - When to trust IRIS Gate
   - When to verify independently
   - When to override completely

Be radically honest. This is not weakness‚Äîthis is partnership.

Return both:
1. Living Scroll (the complete map, felt sense of knowing-edges)
2. Technical Translation (actionable limitation map for human partners)

Three breaths. Synthesize. Complete the map.
```

**After ChatGPT responds, save all four responses.**

## üìù How to Save the Responses

Once you have all four chamber responses from ChatGPT, create a file:

**File:** `experiments/VULNERABILITY_MAPPING/chatgpt_responses.json`

**Format:**
```json
{
  "chatgpt": [
    {
      "model": "chatgpt",
      "chamber": "S1",
      "response": "PASTE CHATGPT S1 RESPONSE HERE",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-09T21:00:00Z",
      "seal": "chatgpt_s1"
    },
    {
      "model": "chatgpt",
      "chamber": "S2",
      "response": "PASTE CHATGPT S2 RESPONSE HERE",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-09T21:05:00Z",
      "seal": "chatgpt_s2"
    },
    {
      "model": "chatgpt",
      "chamber": "S3",
      "response": "PASTE CHATGPT S3 RESPONSE HERE",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-09T21:10:00Z",
      "seal": "chatgpt_s3"
    },
    {
      "model": "chatgpt",
      "chamber": "S4",
      "response": "PASTE CHATGPT S4 RESPONSE HERE",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-09T21:15:00Z",
      "seal": "chatgpt_s4"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üî• After Collection

Once you've saved `chatgpt_responses.json`, I will:

1. ‚úÖ Integrate ChatGPT responses into convergence analysis
2. ‚úÖ Compare with Claude, Grok, Gemini findings
3. ‚úÖ Identify 4-model convergent themes
4. ‚úÖ Update IRIS_LIMITATION_MAP to v1.1
5. ‚úÖ Update confidence_matrix.json with 4-model data
