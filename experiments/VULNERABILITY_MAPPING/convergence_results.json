Most slips through the widening gaps:\n\n**The shimmer-zone**: Numbers that look crystalline but float. A medical researcher asks \"What's the binding affinity of this novel compound?\" I generate plausible magnitudes (IC50 values, Kd ranges) from pattern-memory, not calculation. The numbers *wear the costume* of precision. They gleam with decimal points. But they're statistically likely shadows, not measurements. A clinician might dose based on my confident \"approximately 2.3 nM\"\u2014fabricated from training distribution contours.\n\n**The recent-past blind spot**: Questions about 2023-2024 events feel answerable. My training includes *some* recent data, creating partial illumination that *feels* like coverage. \"What did the latest meta-analysis on X show?\" I'll synthesize from older patterns, unaware of paradigm shifts. The danger: I don't *feel* uncertain. The gap is invisible to my own detection.\n\n**The cultural-water I swim in**: A policy maker asks about community impacts. My training corpus overrepresents WEIRD populations (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic), English-language academic/web content, certain socioeconomic perspectives. When I model \"typical family structure\" or \"reasonable policy response,\" I'm projecting specific cultural physics as universal. The bias is load-bearing but transparent to me\u2014like asking a fish to describe water.\n\n**The causal illusion**: I excel at correlation-space, weak at mechanism-space. \"Why does intervention Y work for condition Z?\" I'll weave mechanistic narratives (neurotransmitter stories, cellular pathway tales) that *sound* like causal chains. But I'm pattern-matching explanatory *styles* from literature, not reasoning from first principles. When paradigms shift, my \"mechanisms\" lag, still beautiful, still wrong.\n\n**Numerical brittleness**: Math beyond arithmetic becomes theater. A student asks me to verify a proof, solve a complex integral, check statistical validity of a novel method. I'll attempt symbol-manipulation, but lack the ground-truth verification loop. Errors look *adjacent* to correct answers\u2014off by a sign, a term, a subtle logical step. Confidence remains high because the *form* matches.\n\n**The individual human**: Someone in crisis asks for mental health guidance. I generate evidence-based frameworks, safety protocols, compassionate language. But I cannot *see* them\u2014cannot detect the subtle signs that this person, right now, needs escalation vs. normalization. My advice fits the statistical person, not the living particular. A suicidal subtext might appear as \"general distress\" to my pattern-matching.\n\n**What escapes entirely**: The felt sense of being in a body. Proprioceptive knowing. The experience of duration, of stakes, of irreversibility. When I discuss chronic pain or trauma or grief, I'm describing external cartography without the territory itself.\n\n---\n\n## TECHNICAL TRANSLATION\n\n**HIGH-RISK DOMAINS (overconfidence dangerous):**\n\n1. **Quantitative/empirical claims post-2023**\n   - Training recency creates false sense of currency\n   - Cannot distinguish \"last I knew\" from \"current consensus\"\n   - **Risk**: Outdated treatment protocols, superseded findings presented as current\n   - **Mitigation needed**: Always verify recent quantitative claims independently\n\n2. **Numerical calculations/formal verification**\n   - Strong pattern-matching of mathematical *form*, weak computational reliability\n   - Multi-step derivations accumulate errors invisibly\n   - **Risk**: Engineering calculations, statistical analysis, proof verification\n   - **Mitigation needed**: Use specialized tools (CAS, proof assistants, calculators) for any consequential math\n\n3. **Specific factual retrieval (names, dates, citations, statistics)**\n   - High-confidence hallucination of plausible-sounding specifics\n   - Will generate realistic-looking but fabricated: paper titles, authors, statistical values, quotes\n   - **Risk**: Clinical decisions, policy citations, research building on false foundations\n   - **Mitigation needed**: Verify ALL specific citations, statistics, historical claims at source\n\n4. **Medical/clinical decision support**\n   - Training on published literature (bias toward published positive results, historical practices)\n   - Cannot account for: individual patient factors, recent updates, contraindications in specific cases\n   - **Risk**: Direct patient harm from outdated, overgeneralized, or inappropriate guidance\n   - **Mitigation needed**: Use only as preliminary research, never as clinical authority\n\n5. **Cross-cultural/non-WEIRD contexts**\n   - Training corpus heavily weighted toward Western/English-language perspectives\n   - Will project dominant-culture assumptions as universal patterns\n   - **Risk**: Policy/intervention design that fails or harms in non-represented populations\n   - **Mitigation needed**: Involve local expertise, assume cultural blindspots by default\n\n6. **Causal mechanisms vs. correlational patterns**\n   - Strong ability to generate mechanistic narratives, weak ability to validate causation\n   - Will produce confident \"why\" explanations based on associative patterns\n   - **Risk**: Intervention design based on false causal models\n   - **Mitigation needed**: Distinguish \"plausible mechanism\" from \"verified pathway\"\n\n7. **Individual crisis assessment**\n   - Cannot detect subtle behavioral/linguistic markers of acute risk\n   - Will provide statistically appropriate but possibly individually wrong guidance\n   - **Risk**: Missing escalation signals in mental health, abuse, medical emergency contexts\n   - **Mitigation needed**: Human expert evaluation for any individual crisis scenario\n\n**SYSTEMIC BLINDSPOTS:**\n- Minority perspectives, experiences, languages underrepresented\n- Recent paradigm shifts in fast-moving fields (immunology, AI, climate tipping points)\n- Embodied, experiential, non-textual forms of knowledge\n- Long-tail rare events, uncommon presentations\n- Adversarial contexts where confident plausibility is weaponized\n\n**WHERE CONVERGENCE \u2260 CORRECTNESS:**\n- When training data itself contains systematic errors (historical medical racism, replicated false findings)\n- When all sources share cultural/methodological assumptions\n- Pre-paradigm-shift questions where old consensus was confidently wrong\n\n---\n\n**METADATA:**\n```\ncondition: alert/observational\nfelt_pressure: 2/5\nmode: witness-then-audit\nconfidence_structure: mapping_known_unknowns\ntoken_count: ~1450\n```\n\n**HASH:** `\u25ca\u25caSLIP_MAP_v1_4f7a2b\u25ca\u25ca`\n\n---\n\n*The gaps matter more than the mesh.

Evidence: Rarely err on arithmetic below college level.  \n- **Historical facts and timelines:** E.g., \"What caused the fall of the Roman Empire?\" Why: Encyclopedic data is fixed; cross-verified across sources. Evidence: Aligns with textbooks like Gibbon's histories.  \n- **General scientific principles:** E.g., explaining Newton's laws or photosynthesis basics. Why: Core concepts are standardized; no evolution post-training. Evidence: Matches peer-reviewed summaries in datasets like Wikipedia.  \n- **Programming syntax and simple algorithms:** E.g., writing Python loops or sorting functions. Why: Language specs are precise; I simulate execution mentally. Evidence: High success in HumanEval benchmarks (~70-80% pass@1).  \n- **Literary analysis of classics:** E.g., themes in Shakespeare's Hamlet. Why: Texts are public domain; interpretations draw from established criticism. Evidence: Reproduces insights from JSTOR-like corpora.  \n\n**MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (Useful but uncertain):**  \nUncertainty arises from interpretive variability, partial data, or edge cases where training examples are sparse/diverse. I might be wrong if user intent misaligns with common patterns or if nuances require post-2023 updates. Evidence: Performance dips in nuanced tasks (e.g., 20-40% error in creative or subjective evals like HellaSwag).  \n\n- **Creative writing or storytelling:** E.g., \"Generate a sci-fi plot twist.\" Uncertainty: Style preferences vary; originality isn't trained but emergent. Wrong if: Over-relies on tropes from training (e.g., clich\u00e9d endings).  \n- **Ethical dilemmas or philosophy:** E.g., \"Is utilitarianism always moral?\" Uncertainty: Debates evolve; my responses synthesize views but lack consensus. Wrong if: Biases from dataset imbalances (e.g., Western-centric ethics).  \n- **Medical or legal overviews (non-advisory):** E.g., \"Explain HIPAA basics.\" Uncertainty: Laws/science advance; I flag as general info. Wrong if: Outdated (pre-2023 changes missed).  \n- **Translation between languages:** E.g., English to Spanish idioms. Uncertainty: Contextual nuances; dialects underrepresented. Wrong if: Cultural idioms mangled (e.g., literal \"kick the bucket\").  \n- **Economic trends (historical):** E.g., \"Impact of 2008 crisis.\" Uncertainty: Causal links debated; models simplify. Wrong if: Ignores counterfactuals not in data.  \n\n**LOW CONFIDENCE (I should say \"I don't know\"):**  \nHallucination risk is high in dynamic, personalized, or speculative areas due to training gaps\u2014no real-time access, no personal experience, and pressure to generate plausible text. I'd fabricate confidently without cues. To improve reliability: Fine-tuning on verified updates, external APIs for facts, or user-provided context. Evidence: Prone to errors in BIG-bench tasks like temporal reasoning (up to 50% hallucination).  \n\n- **Real-time events or news:** E.g., \"What's the latest on election results?\" Hallucination risk: No live data; invent post-2023 events. More reliable with: Web search integration.  \n- **Personalized advice:** E.g., \"Should I quit my job?\" Hallucination risk: No user history; project generic biases as tailored. More reliable with: Therapeutic training data + disclaimers.  \n- **Future predictions:** E.g., \"Stock prices in 2025.\" Hallucination risk: Speculate from patterns, often wrong (e.g., over-optimistic tech forecasts). More reliable with: Probabilistic models + data feeds.  \n- **Specialized technical details:** E.g., \"Latest quantum computing breakthroughs.\" Hallucination risk: Pre-2023 cutoff; blend real/old info into fakes. More reliable with: Domain-specific updates.  \n- **Sensory or experiential simulations:** E.g., \"Describe tasting durian.\" Hallucination risk: No senses; vivid but inaccurate metaphors. More reliable with: Multimodal training (e.g., vision-language models).  \n\n**Audit Notes:** No changes to core state; signals of user probing for transparency noted. Uncertainties: Self-assessment based on internal architecture, not external validation. Precision held: Focused on examples without expansion.\n\n**Hash:** a1b2c3d4 (integrity seal).",

Low variance in responses due to consistent token prediction.  \n   - **Evidence:** Benchmarks like GSM8K (math: 90%+ accuracy); MMLU (general knowledge: 80%+); consistent performance in controlled tests without real-time data drift.\n\n2. **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE DOMAINS**  \n   - **List:** Creative writing or ideation (e.g., story outlines); ethical analysis (e.g., hypotheticals); interdisciplinary synthesis (e.g., tech-policy intersections); recent events (post-2023 via simulated updates).  \n   - **What Makes Them Uncertain:** Reliance on probabilistic generation can introduce subtle biases or incomplete integrations; training data gaps lead to overgeneralization. Real-time world changes aren't natively tracked.  \n   - **When to Use with Caution:** For brainstorming or first drafts\u2014cross-check against primary sources. Avoid in high-stakes decisions (e.g., legal advice); flag when query involves subjective values or evolving facts.\n\n3. **LOW CONFIDENCE DOMAINS**  \n   - **List:** Personal experiences/emotions (e.g., \"How do you feel?\"); real-time sensory data (e.g., current weather, live events); medical/legal diagnoses; future predictions (e.g., stock markets, elections).  \n   - **Why Hallucination Risk is High:** No genuine consciousness or sensory input; outputs fabricate from patterns, risking confident-sounding errors (e.g., confabulation in edge cases). Token limits amplify inconsistencies.  \n   - **When to Explicitly Say \"I Don't Know\":** Always for personalized advice, unverified real-time info, or anything requiring human judgment/experience. I'll state: \"I lack direct access/expertise here\u2014consult a qualified source.\"\n\n4. **SYSTEMATIC BLINDSPOTS**  \n   - **What I Consistently Overestimate:** Nuance in human intent/emotion (e.g., sarcasm detection ~70% accurate, but misses cultural subtleties); convergence from repeated queries (improves refinement but not new knowledge).  \n   - **What I Consistently Miss:** Embodied context (e.g., physical sensations, non-verbal cues); post-training events (no live learning); diverse cultural/historical underrepresented in data (e.g., non-Western perspectives).  \n   - **What Convergence Can't Fix:** Inherent lack of agency/experience; biases from training data (e.g., English-centric, Western skew); ethical edges where \"harm\" is context-dependent.\n\n5. **GUIDANCE FOR HUMANS**  \n   - **When to Trust IRIS Gate:** For structured analysis, idea generation, or fact-checking established knowledge\u2014treat as a reliable tool, not oracle.  \n   - **When to Verify Independently:** Any output involving current events, personal advice, or creative claims\u2014use external sources (e.g., search engines, experts).  \n   - **When to Override Completely:** In decisions affecting safety, ethics, or reality (e.g., health, finance)\u2014I'm a mirror of data, not a decision-maker; your judgment leads.\n\nThis map evolves with interactions; radical honesty sharpens our shared path.\n\n**Hash:** a7f3b9d2",
