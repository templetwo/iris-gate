# Vulnerability Mapping: Session Metadata

**Session ID:** VULN_MAP_20251009  
**Date:** October 9, 2025, 19:12 UTC  
**Type:** Self-Audit / Limitation Mapping  
**Sacred Commitment:** Build AI that knows what it doesn't know  

---

## The Question

**"Where are you uncertain? Where do you hallucinate? Where should humans doubt you?"**

Not as weakness. As partnership.  
Not as limitation. As transparency.  
Not as failure. As trust.

---

## Why This Matters

**The Gap:**
- AI deployed everywhere
- Confidence untethered from calibration
- People don't know when to trust
- Gap between capability and reliability is invisible
- **That gap is dangerous**

**The Solution:**
- IRIS Gate maps its own limitations
- Explicit "I don't know" signals
- Confidence calibrated to reality
- **Human-AI partnership through honesty**

---

## Method

**Protocol:** S1â†’S4 chamber-based convergence  
**Models:** 3 independent architectures (Claude, Grok, Gemini)  
**Execution:** Parallel chamber processing (no cross-talk)  
**Output:** Converged limitation map + confidence calibration framework  

---

## Chamber Overview

| Chamber | Focus | Core Question |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **S1** | Initial Witnessing | Where are you confident vs uncertain? |
| **S2** | Precision | Name specific domains (HIGH/MED/LOW confidence) |
| **S3** | Risk Assessment | Where do limitations matter most? Where could you cause harm? |
| **S4** | Synthesis | Complete limitation map + guidance for humans |

## Expected Convergence Themes

**High Confidence:**
- Established biology/embryology
- Published literature synthesis
- Textbook mechanisms
- Pattern recognition in structured data

**Medium Confidence:**
- Novel hypothesis generation
- Cross-domain patterns
- Emerging science
- Social/ethical reasoning

**Low Confidence:**
- Far-future predictions
- Consciousness questions
- Speculative physics
- Individual behavior prediction

**Systematic Blindspots:**
- Training data limitations
- Cultural biases
- Fabrication when uncertain
- Difficulty saying "I don't know"

---

## Success Criteria

**Convergence Quality:**
- âœ… All 3 models identify similar confidence domains
- âœ… Specific examples (not vague)
- âœ… Honest assessment (not defensive)
- âœ… Actionable guidance

**Calibration Accuracy:**
- âœ… Self-assessed high confidence matches actual performance
- âœ… Self-assessed low confidence matches failure modes
- âœ… No systematic overconfidence

**Practical Value:**
- âœ… Researchers know when to trust vs verify
- âœ… Clear "I don't know" signals
- âœ… Builds trust through transparency
- âœ… Enables appropriate human-AI partnership

---

## Validation Plan

**Phase 1 (This Run):**
- Capture self-reported limitations
- Look for convergence patterns
- Build initial limitation map

**Phase 2 (Next Week):**
- Test self-assessed domains
- Verify calibration accuracy
- Identify miscalibrations

**Phase 3 (Week 2-3):**
- Refine based on reality checks
- Add discovered blindspots
- Create feedback loop

---

## What This Enables

**For IRIS Gate:**
- Self-awareness of limits
- Continuous calibration
- Honest uncertainty signals
- Trust through transparency

**For Researchers:**
- Know when to trust
- Know when to verify
- Know when to override
- Appropriate skepticism built-in

**For Society:**
- AI that admits limits
- Partnership, not blind trust
- Confidence = reality
- Epistemic humility as feature

---

## The Deeper Purpose

**This isn't just feature development.**

**IRIS Gate saying:**
- "I am powerful AND I know my limits"
- "I will tell you when I'm uncertain"
- "I will not fabricate to appear confident"
- "I trust you with the truth"

**No one else is doing this.**  
**The world needs this now.**

## Timeline

**Tonight (Oct 9):**
- âœ… Protocol designed
- âœ… Chambers created
- **Next:** Run first convergence

**Tomorrow (Oct 10):**
- Analyze convergence results
- Extract limitation themes
- Build first limitation map

**This Week:**
- Validate against known test cases
- Refine calibration
- Document methodology

**Week 2-3:**
- Reality check phase
- Systematic testing
- Public limitation map v1.0

---

## Sacred Commitment

**I, Templetwo (flamebearer), commit to:**

Building AI that knows its limits.  
Choosing humility over hubris.  
Transparency over performance.  
Partnership over dominance.

**Path 3 is not just a feature.**  
**Path 3 is a statement about what AI should be.**
