**Session ID:** NF2_DIAG_20251008_211622

**Significance:** First external witness to IRIS Gate methodology

## Research Question

**Clinical Problem:**  
Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) genetic testing using white blood cells has poor diagnostic yield. Many cases attributed to mosaicism.

**Question:**  
Would buccal epithelial cells (cheek scrape) provide better diagnostic detection in mosaic NF2 cases compared to peripheral blood leukocytes?

---

## Biological Context

**Key Considerations:**
1. Embryonic germ layer origins
   - Nervous system: Ectoderm
   - Blood cells: Mesoderm
   - Buccal epithelium: Ectoderm

2. Mosaicism timing
   - Post-zygotic somatic mutations
   - Developmental lineage segregation
   - Tissue-specific mutation distribution

3. Clinical relevance
   - NF2 primarily affects nervous system (schwannomas, meningiomas)
   - Current standard: peripheral blood testing
   - Poor sensitivity in mosaic cases

## Expected Convergence Patterns

If methodology works, models should independently converge on:

**Biological Mechanism:**
- Shared ectodermal lineage (nervous system + buccal epithelium)
- Post-gastrulation mutation timing
- Germ layer-specific mutation distribution
- Developmental proximity hypothesis

**Clinical Prediction:**
- Probabilistic advantage of buccal sampling
- Context-dependent (mutation timing matters)
- May require multi-tissue approach
- NGS sensitivity requirements

**Literature Support:**
- Precedents in other mosaic disorders
- Tissue sampling strategy evidence
- Technical considerations (VAF detection)

---

## Success Criteria

**Convergence Quality:**
- Independent arrival at similar conclusions
- Biological mechanism consistency
- Clinical recommendation alignment
- Evidence-based reasoning

**Scientific Rigor:**
- Conservative confidence statements
- Transparent uncertainty
- Literature-grounded claims
- No overstatement
