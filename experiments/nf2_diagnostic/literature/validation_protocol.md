## Central Hypothesis (Convergence)

**Buccal swabs are superior to blood samples for detecting mosaic NF2 mutations due to shared ectodermal lineage between buccal epithelium and neural tissues.**

### Mechanism
Early post-zygotic NF2 mutations occurring in ectodermal progenitor cells will be:
1. **Enriched** in neural tissues (vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas)
2. **Enriched** in buccal epithelium (shared ectodermal origin)
3. **Absent or low-frequency** in blood (mesodermal origin)

## Validation Criteria (CBD-Quality Standards)

### **High-Quality Evidence** (Tier 1)
- Peer-reviewed primary research
- Prospective or well-controlled retrospective studies
- Sample size >10 patients (for rare disease)
- Clear methodology for VAF quantification
- Comparison of â‰¥2 tissue types in same individual

### **Supporting Evidence** (Tier 2)
- Case reports/case series (nâ‰¥3)
- Expert reviews with cited data
- Developmental biology textbooks (established facts)
- Mathematical/computational models with validation

### **Contextual Evidence** (Tier 3)
- Single case reports
- Opinion pieces by domain experts
- Indirect evidence from related conditions
- Mechanistic studies in model organisms

## Expected Outcomes

### **Hypothesis Supported** (Strong)
- â‰¥3 Tier 1 studies showing buccal > blood for mosaic detection
- Clear embryological evidence for lineage separation
- Clinical case reports demonstrating diagnostic utility

### **Hypothesis Supported** (Moderate)
- â‰¥2 Tier 1 studies OR â‰¥5 Tier 2 studies
- Embryological basis established
- No contradictory evidence

### **Hypothesis Neutral/Weak**
- Indirect evidence only
- Mixed results in comparative studies
- Gaps in embryological understanding

### **Hypothesis Contradicted**
- Studies showing blood â‰¥ buccal for mosaic NF2
- Evidence against lineage-based enrichment
- Clinical guidelines explicitly recommend blood only
