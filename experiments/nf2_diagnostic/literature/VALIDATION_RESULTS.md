## Overall Validation Assessment

### Hypothesis Support Summary

**Hypothesis:** Buccal swabs superior to blood for mosaic NF2 detection due to shared ectodermal lineage

**Evidence Strength:**
- Ectodermal lineage (expected strong - textbook embryology)
- NF2 mosaicism patterns (pending literature)
- Buccal vs blood comparative data (critical - pending literature)
- Clinical validation (pending case reports)

**Converged Prediction vs Literature:**
*[Assessment pending after search completion]*

### Confidence Statement

*[To be populated after systematic literature review]*

**Strength of Support:**
- [ ] **Strong:** â‰¥3 Tier 1 studies + embryological confirmation + clinical evidence
- [ ] **Moderate:** â‰¥2 Tier 1 OR â‰¥5 Tier 2 + embryological basis
- [ ] **Weak:** Indirect evidence only, gaps in validation
- [ ] **Contradicted:** Evidence against lineage-based hypothesis

### Gaps Requiring Primary Research

*[To be identified during literature review]*

1. [TBD]
2. [TBD]
3. [TBD]

### Recommendations for Professor Heise

*[Final recommendations pending literature validation completion]*
