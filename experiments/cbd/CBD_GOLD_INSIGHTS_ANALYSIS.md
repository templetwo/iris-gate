## üéØ Executive Summary

### Critical Evolution: v1.0 ‚Üí v2.1

**v1.0 (Original, 90% validation):**
- Mechanistic struggle: VDAC1 mischaracterized as "central therapeutic mechanism"
- Selectivity gap: 2.86 ref ‚Üí 1.53 S8 document (43% reduction)
- Required meta-questioning to resolve conflation

**v2.1 (Re-convergence, 99.4% validation):**
- Direct attractor lock: 85% convergence, no framework questioning needed
