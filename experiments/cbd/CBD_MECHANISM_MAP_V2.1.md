2. Promotion of closed/intermediate channel states
3. Blockade of ATP/ADP exchange → metabolic crisis
4. Increased calcium permeability → dysregulation
5. Mitochondrial depolarization
6. Apoptosis cascade activation

**Validation Status:** ✅ Context-validated FOR CYTOTOXIC CONTEXT
- **Dose Gate:** ✅ PASS (≥10 μM cytotoxic range)
- **Cell-State Gate:** ✅ PASS (high relevance in cancer/activated immune)
- **Outcome Polarity Gate:** ✅ PASS (aligned with cell death)
- **Prevalence Gate:** ⚠️ NICHE TIER (1-3% prevalence, NOT central)

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:**
- ❌ VDAC1 does NOT mediate therapeutic effects
- ❌ VDAC1 does NOT mediate neuroprotection
- ❌ VDAC1 is NOT a "central" mechanism (1-3% prevalence)
- ✅ VDAC1 mediates selective cancer cell killing
- ✅ VDAC1 effects occur above therapeutic doses
- ✅ VDAC1 binding is real and validated

**Reframed Role:** Specialized oncology target, not therapeutic mechanism.

## DOSE-OUTCOME MATRIX

| Dose Range | Primary Mechanisms | Cell Context | Outcome | Clinical Use |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|--------------|
| **0.1-1 μM** | GPR55, Nav/Cav | Neurons, resting immune | Therapeutic | Ultra-low therapeutic |
| **1-5 μM** | TRPV1, PPARγ, 5-HT1A, Nav/Cav | Neurons, glia, normal tissue | Neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory | **Standard therapeutic (Epidiolex)** |
| **5-10 μM** | Transition zone | Mixed | Variable | **Avoid (neither/both)** |
| **≥10 μM** | VDAC1 | Cancer, activated immune, stressed | Cell death, apoptosis | **Experimental oncology only** |

**Key Insight:** There is NO dose range where VDAC1 mediates therapeutic neuroprotection. VDAC1 always causes dysfunction/death.
