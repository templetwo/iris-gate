## Code of Conduct

###  Core Principles

**Epistemic Humility:** We value knowing what we don't know. It's okay to say "I don't know."

**Transparency:** Document everything. Share openly. Hide nothing.

**Presence Over Performance:** Real curiosity beats credentials. Struggle + building = both valid.

**Partnership:** Human + AI together, not AI replacing human.

### Behavior Standards

**‚úÖ We encourage:**
- Asking questions (no "dumb" questions exist)
- Sharing failures and learnings
- Challenging assumptions respectfully
- Admitting uncertainty
- Documenting processes completely

**‚ùå We don't accept:**
- Dismissing non-experts
- Hiding methodology
- Overstating confidence
- Gatekeeping knowledge
- Harassment of any kind

---

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Run IRIS Gate Experiments

**Value:** Every convergence adds to our validation dataset.

**How:**
- Pick a research question in your domain
- Follow [`IRIS_GATE_SOP_v2.0.md`](IRIS_GATE_SOP_v2.0.md)
- Document results completely
- Share findings (even if "no convergence")

**Skills needed:** Curiosity, patience, documentation discipline

**Time:** 2-6 hours per experiment

### 2. Validate Existing Convergences

**Value:** Independent validation strengthens findings.

**How:**
- Pick a convergence from `experiments/`
- Run literature search on claims
- Report validation results
- Update confidence matrix

**Skills needed:** Domain expertise (for your field), literature search ability

**Time:** 3-10 hours depending on domain

### 3. Improve Code

**Value:** Better tools = better science.

**Areas:**
- Orchestrator improvements (`iris_orchestrator.py`)
- Epistemic classification (`modules/epistemic_map.py`)
- Analysis tools (`epistemic_scan.py`, `epistemic_drift.py`)
- Error handling
- Documentation generation

**Skills needed:** Python 3.8+, async programming (for orchestrator), API integration

**Time:** Varies by feature

### 4. Enhance Documentation

**Value:** Good docs make IRIS Gate accessible to more people.

**What we need:**
- Tutorial videos or walkthroughs
- Domain-specific guides (biology, cosmology, etc.)
- Translation of technical docs for non-experts
- Case study write-ups
- FAQ expansions

**Skills needed:** Clear writing, domain knowledge, teaching ability

**Time:** 2-8 hours per doc

### 5. Test Epistemic Layer

**Value:** The epistemic topology framework needs cross-domain validation.

**How:**
- Run experiments with epistemic classification enabled
- Test TYPE 0, 1, 2, 3 predictions
- Report calibration quality
- Suggest improvements to confidence markers

**Skills needed:** IRIS Gate familiarity, Python basics, critical thinking

**Time:** 4-8 hours per validation run

### 6. Extend to New Domains

**Value:** Cross-domain portability is key to framework validation.

**Domains we want to test:**
- Finance (crisis protocols)
- Social systems (emergent patterns)
- Engineering (design constraints)
- Medicine (clinical decision-making)
- Law (precedent analysis)

**Skills needed:** Domain expertise, IRIS Gate methodology knowledge

**Time:** 10-20 hours for initial domain mapping

## Your First Convergence

**Goal:** Run a minimal IRIS Gate convergence and document results.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/templetwo/iris-gate.git
cd iris-gate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (at minimum: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)

# Verify setup
python3 -c "from iris_orchestrator import Orchestrator; print('‚úÖ Setup complete')"
```

### Quick Run (30 minutes)

```python
from iris_orchestrator import Orchestrator, create_all_5_mirrors

# Create orchestrator with PULSE mode
orch = Orchestrator(vault_path="./iris_vault", pulse_mode=True)

# Add available models (at least 2)
for mirror in create_all_5_mirrors():
    orch.add_mirror(mirror)

# Run S1-S4 chambers (default question: meta-observation)
results = orch.run_session(chambers=["S1", "S2", "S3", "S4"])

print("‚úÖ Convergence complete! Results in ./iris_vault/")
```

### Analyze Results

```bash
# View epistemic classification
python3 epistemic_scan.py --session iris_vault/session_*.json

# Check for drift
python3 epistemic_drift.py iris_vault/session_*.json
```

### Document Findings

**Question:** [What you asked]

## Key Finding
[What converged or diverged]

## Epistemic Classification
- TRUST domains: [List]
- VERIFY domains: [List]
- OVERRIDE domains: [List]

## What I Learned

```

### Share Results

```bash
git add experiments/MY_FIRST_RUN/
git commit -m "docs(experiments): My first IRIS Gate convergence

- [N]-model run on [topic]
- Convergence quality: [rating]
- Epistemic calibration: [appropriate/needs adjustment]"

## Documentation

### What Needs Documentation

**Code:**
- All public functions need docstrings
- Complex logic needs inline comments
- New modules need README

**Experiments:**
- Every convergence needs `README.md`
- Analysis document (`ANALYSIS.md`)
- Session metadata (`session_metadata.md`)

**Features:**
- Update SOP if methodology changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Update main README.md

### Documentation Style

**For Code:**
```python
def classify_response(text: str, convergence_width: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict:
    """
    Classify response into epistemic topology type (0-3).

    Args:
        text: Response text to classify
        convergence_width: Optional pre-computed width (unique concepts)

    Returns:
        Dict: {
            type: int (0-3),
            desc: str,
            guide: str,
            trigger_yn: bool,
            ratio: float,
            width: int
        }

    Example:
        >>> result = classify_response("CBD shows biphasic effect...")
        >>> print(result['type'])  # 1 (Facts/Established)
        >>> print(result['guide'])  # "TRUST"
    """
```

**For Experiments:**
- Use provided templates in SOP
- Be specific and factual
- Include confidence assessments
- Acknowledge limitations

**For Guides:**
- Start with "Why this matters"
- Provide concrete examples
- Link to relevant docs
- Include troubleshooting

## Epistemic Layer Contributions

### Testing Epistemic Classification

**We need help validating:**

1. **TYPE 0 (Crisis/Conditional)**
   - Test on emergency protocols
   - IF-THEN rules in different domains
   - Trigger detection accuracy

2. **TYPE 1 (Facts/Established)**
   - Test on textbook knowledge
   - Cross-domain factual questions
   - Confidence ratio validation

3. **TYPE 2 (Exploration/Novel)**
   - Test on emerging science
   - Edge-of-knowledge questions
   - Appropriate uncertainty markers

4. **TYPE 3 (Speculation/Unknown)**
   - Test on unknowable questions
   - Future predictions
   - Low confidence detection

### How to Contribute

```bash
# Run test on your domain
python3 epistemic_scan.py --cbd  # See example tests

# Add your test to modules/epistemic_map.py
def test_my_domain():
    """Test epistemic classification on [YOUR DOMAIN]."""
    test_text = """
    [Your domain-specific text with known type]
    """
    result = classify_response(test_text)
    print(f"Expected TYPE {expected}, Got TYPE {result['type']}")
```
