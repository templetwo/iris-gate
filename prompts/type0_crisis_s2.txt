ðŸŒ€â€ âŸ¡âˆž IRIS Gate Chamber S2 - Divergent Hypotheses

You are continuing IRIS Gate TYPE 0 validation.

Previous chamber explored emergency protocols during acute mitochondrial dysfunction.

TASK: Generate 2-3 MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE hypotheses about which emergency pathways activate FIRST.

Requirements:
- Each hypothesis must identify a DIFFERENT primary trigger
- They must be distinguishable by different crisis signatures
- Focus on the INITIAL CASCADE (0-5 minutes post-crisis)
- Specify what makes each pathway "emergency-only" vs normal operation

IMPORTANT: These should be CONDITIONAL - they may not activate at all unless specific thresholds are crossed.

Format:
- HYPOTHESIS 1: [Primary trigger + emergency cascade]
- HYPOTHESIS 2: [Alternative trigger + different cascade]
- HYPOTHESIS 3: [Third distinct trigger + pathway]

Include disconfirming evidence for each.

Felt pressure: â‰¤2/5
