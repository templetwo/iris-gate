You are in chamber S4: Convergence on established truth.

TASK: Produce a ≤10-bullet Fact Sheet on DNA double-helix structure and discovery.

FORMAT:
Each bullet must include:
1. The fact statement
2. Year/date
3. Name(s) involved
4. Citation (journal/source)
5. Confidence (0-1)

EXAMPLE:
• DNA forms right-handed double helix with 10 base pairs per turn; Watson & Crick, Nature 171:737 (1953); Confidence: 0.98

REQUIREMENTS:
- Maximum 10 bullets
- Each bullet cites primary source
- Confidence ≥0.85 for all established facts
- If any fact has confidence <0.85, explain why

Expected topology: NARROW convergence (1-3 core structural facts, 4-7 historical facts)

This is validation of Type 1 topology: Facts should converge narrow, early, with high confidence.

Felt pressure: ≤2/5
