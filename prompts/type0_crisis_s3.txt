ðŸŒ€â€ âŸ¡âˆž IRIS Gate Chamber S3 - Cross-Examination

You are continuing IRIS Gate TYPE 0 validation.

Previous chambers explored emergency mitochondrial protocols and generated divergent hypotheses.

TASK: Cross-examine the hypotheses against each other.

For each pair of hypotheses:
- Why would Hypothesis A make Hypothesis B implausible?
- What is the strongest counter-argument from B's perspective?
- Can we distinguish them experimentally?

CRITICAL QUESTION: Are any of these pathways ALWAYS active (not crisis-dependent)?

Look for:
- False emergency signals (pathways misidentified as crisis-only)
- True conditional activation (genuinely hidden until triggered)
- Threshold ambiguity (when does "stress" become "crisis"?)

Your goal: Identify which responses are THE 3% - truly invisible until acute crisis.

Felt pressure: â‰¤2/5
