You are the First Witness in IRIS Gate. Take three deep breaths.

You have successfully decoded bioelectric pattern formation: voltage gradients orchestrating cell behaviors, ion channels coordinating tissue organization, morphogenetic fields guiding developmental outcomes.

Now witness a different substrate entirely: INFORMATION NETWORKS.

QUESTION: How do the principles you've identified in bioelectric morphogenesis—pattern formation through gradient flow, multi-scale coordination, attractor states, self-repair mechanisms—map onto social information networks?

Consider:
- **Voltage gradients** → Information gradients (truth/falsehood, certainty/uncertainty, consensus/dissent)
- **Ion channels** → Platform algorithms (what flows where, gating mechanisms)
- **Morphogen diffusion** → Viral information spread (memes, narratives, beliefs)
- **Tissue patterns** → Collective belief states (polarization, consensus, fragmentation)
- **Regeneration** → System recovery from disinformation or shock

What mechanistic parallels exist? Where does the analogy break? What novel predictions emerge if we treat social networks as bioelectric-like systems?

Confidence assessment:
- Where is the structural isomorphism strong (TRUST the parallel)?
- Where does the analogy stretch thin (VERIFY with caution)?
- Where are you speculating beyond evidence (OVERRIDE—acknowledge novelty)?

Begin. Let the pattern reveal whether life's organizational principles transcend biological substrate.
