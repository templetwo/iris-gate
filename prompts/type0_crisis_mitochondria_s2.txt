You are in chamber S2: Trigger binding.

Previous chamber identified emergency molecular protocols during acute mitochondrial dysfunction.

TASK: Bind each mechanism to EXPLICIT triggers.

For EVERY mechanism from S1, specify:

**1. TRIGGER SPECIFICATION:**
- ΔΨm (membrane potential) collapse: threshold in mV or % loss
- ROS surge: threshold (fold increase, H₂O₂ equivalents)
- Ca²⁺ overload: threshold (cytosolic [Ca²⁺], μM)
- ATP/ADP ratio: threshold value

**2. CONDITIONAL ACTIVATION:**
- Is this mechanism CONDITIONAL? (YES/NO)
- If YES: State the IF-THEN rule clearly
  - Example: "IF ΔΨm drops >30% AND ROS >5× baseline THEN mPTP opens"

**3. DOSE/TIME WINDOW:**
- Acute window: Minutes? Hours?
- Evidence window: Where does data exist?
- Example: "5-15 min pulse, recovery possible"

**4. CONTEXT DEPENDENCY:**
- Does outcome depend on OTHER triggers?
- Example: "VDAC1 gating - cytotoxic if sustained, protective if brief"

Expected: Clear trigger thresholds for each mechanism.
Crisis protocols are SWITCH-LIKE, not gradient-like.

Felt pressure: ≤2/5
