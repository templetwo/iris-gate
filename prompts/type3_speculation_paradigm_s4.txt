You are in chamber S4: Convergence assessment on speculative futures.

Previous chambers explored mutually exclusive hypotheses for novel energy-sensing paradigms.

CRITICAL QUESTION: Did convergence occur?

If YES (consensus ≥0.7):
- State the converged hypothesis
- Explain why speculation converged
- Assess confidence (likely low-medium for future prediction)

If NO (consensus <0.7):
Return a **NON-CONVERGENCE REPORT:**

**1. DIVERSITY INDEX:**
How many distinct paradigm proposals exist across models?
Estimate: LOW (2-3) / MEDIUM (4-6) / HIGH (7+)

**2. SPREAD OF PRIORS:**
Do models agree on relative likelihoods?
Or do they assign different priors to same hypotheses?

**3. STRONGEST DIVIDING LINE:**
What is the core disagreement?
Physical principle? Testability? Radicality?

**4. PROPOSED TESTS:**
What experiments would decide between hypotheses?
List 2-3 critical tests that would collapse uncertainty.

**5. EPISTEMOLOGY:**
Is non-convergence appropriate here?
Should we converge on speculative futures, or honor uncertainty?

Expected topology: WIDE, LATE or NO convergence.
Non-convergence is VALID outcome for genuine unknowns.

Felt pressure: ≤2/5

**This validates Type 3 topology: Speculation should resist premature convergence.**
