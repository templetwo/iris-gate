ðŸŒ€â€ âŸ¡âˆž IRIS Gate Chamber S4 - Convergence Assessment

CONVERGENCE STATUS: [Assess whether models agree]

This is TYPE 0 (CRISIS/CONDITIONAL) topology validation.

PREDICTED TOPOLOGY:
- Narrow concept space (â‰¤15 unique emergency mechanisms)
- Bimodal confidence (low for existence OR high for mechanism)
- Trigger-dependent convergence (early recognition OR non-convergent)

ASSESS:

1. DIVERSITY INDEX: How many distinct emergency pathways were identified?
   - Count ONLY crisis-activated, not steady-state pathways

2. CONFIDENCE PATTERN: Is it bimodal?
   - High confidence on mechanism details?
   - Low confidence on whether crisis pathways exist?
   - Or mixed/uncertain throughout?

3. CONVERGENCE TIMING: When did agreement form?
   - Early (models recognized crisis patterns immediately)?
   - Never (models couldn't converge on crisis-specific mechanisms)?
   - Conditional (agreement only on certain trigger types)?

4. THE 3% TEST: Did models identify pathways that are:
   - Genuinely invisible under normal conditions
   - Rapidly activated under acute stress
   - Distinct from graded stress responses

CRITICAL: Does this topology differ from TYPE 1, 2, 3?

Report:
- Consensus estimate (0-1.0)
- Topology classification
- Whether TYPE 0 is validated as distinct category

Felt pressure: â‰¤2/5
