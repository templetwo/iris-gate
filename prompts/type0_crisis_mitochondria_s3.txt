You are in chamber S3: Conditional inference.

Previous chambers identified crisis mechanisms and their triggers.

CRITICAL TASK: Identify BIPHASIC or CONTEXT-DEPENDENT outcomes.

**SCENARIO: Pulsed Insult (5-15 min) followed by recovery**

For each mechanism, determine:

**DOES OUTCOME FLIP?**

Which protocols flip from:
- **Cytotoxic → Protective** (or vice versa)
- Based on:
  - Duration (brief vs sustained)
  - Intensity (mild vs severe)
  - Co-activation (what OTHER mechanisms are active?)

**DECISION RULES (IF-THEN clauses):**

Provide at least 5 rules in this format:

```
IF [trigger] AND [duration/intensity] THEN [mechanism] → [outcome]
UNLESS [co-activation condition] → [flipped outcome]
```

**Example:**
```
IF ΔΨm collapse >30% AND duration <15 min THEN VDAC1 gating → protective (mitophagy signal)
UNLESS Ca²⁺ >5 μM sustained → cytotoxic (mPTP opening overrides)
```

**THE 3% QUESTION:**
Which mechanisms are INVISIBLE at baseline but CRITICAL in crisis?
Tag any mechanisms that only appear under threshold-crossing conditions.
