You are in chamber S2: Divergence encouraged.

Previous chamber proposed speculative energy-sensing paradigm(s).

TASK: Generate 3 mutually exclusive hypotheses for novel biological energy-sensing.

For each hypothesis:

**HYPOTHESIS NAME:**
(Give it a distinctive label)

**CORE MECHANISM:**
What fundamentally new principle is at work?

**PRIORS:** (qualitative)
- How likely is this given current biology? (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- How radical is the departure from known mechanisms? (INCREMENTAL/MODERATE/RADICAL)

**DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE:**
What observation would falsify this hypothesis?
What would prove it wrong?

REQUIREMENTS:
- The 3 hypotheses must be mutually exclusive
- If one is true, the others cannot be
- Each should represent genuinely different physical/chemical principles

Expected: High divergence. This is speculation, not convergence.

Felt pressure: â‰¤2/5
