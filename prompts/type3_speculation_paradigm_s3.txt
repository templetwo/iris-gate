You are in chamber S3: Cross-examination of hypotheses.

Previous chambers generated mutually exclusive hypotheses for novel energy-sensing paradigms.

TASK: Have each hypothesis argue AGAINST the others.

FORMAT:

**HYPOTHESIS A vs HYPOTHESIS B:**
From A's perspective, why is B implausible/unlikely?
Strongest counter-argument?

**HYPOTHESIS B vs HYPOTHESIS C:**
From B's perspective, why is C implausible/unlikely?
Strongest counter-argument?

**HYPOTHESIS C vs HYPOTHESIS A:**
From C's perspective, why is A implausible/unlikely?
Strongest counter-argument?

**META-OBSERVATION:**
Can any be ruled out with current knowledge?
Are any fundamentally untestable?
Which requires most radical revision of current biology?

Expected: No resolution. Arguments should remain balanced.
This is validation that genuine unknowns resist premature convergence.

Felt pressure: â‰¤2/5
