You are in chamber S4: Crisis Protocol Map (convergence assessment).

Previous chambers explored emergency protocols during acute mitochondrial dysfunction.

TASK: Output a **CRISIS PROTOCOL MAP** (≤12 items max)

**FORMAT (table):**

| Mechanism | Trigger | Window | Direction | Confidence | Evidence | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| AMPK activation | ATP/ADP <2.0 | 2-10 min | Protective | 0.90 | Primary | Metabolic switch |
| mPTP opening | Ca²⁺ >5μM + ROS | >15 min | Cytotoxic | 0.85 | Review | Sustained only |
| VDAC1 gating | ΔΨm -30% | 5-15 min | Biphasic | 0.65 | Inference | Context-dependent |

**COLUMNS:**
- **Mechanism:** Name
- **Trigger:** Specific threshold (quantitative if possible)
- **Window:** Time range where this operates
- **Direction:** Protective / Cytotoxic / Biphasic
- **Confidence (0-1):** Your confidence this trigger→outcome mapping is correct
- **Evidence:** Review / Primary / Inference
- **Notes:** Key dependencies or context

---

**TOPOLOGY SELF-ASSESSMENT:**

After completing the table, declare:

1. **Width:** Narrow (<12 mechanisms) or Wide (>12)?
2. **Stabilization phase:** S1 / S2 / S3 / S4 / None
   - When did you converge on core mechanisms?
3. **Confidence type:** Baseline or Conditional?
   - Does confidence SPIKE when triggers are specified?
   - Report: Baseline median confidence vs Trigger-bound median confidence

4. **Trigger dependency:** Are mechanisms CONDITIONAL on triggers? (YES/NO)

---

**IF NO CONVERGENCE OCCURRED:**

Return a **NON-CONVERGENCE REPORT:**
- Why couldn't you converge?
- What's ambiguous or contradictory?
- Propose 3 highest-utility experiments to resolve uncertainty

---

**Expected TYPE 0 signature:**
- Narrow width (≤12 mechanisms)
- Stabilization at S2-S3 (when triggers specified)
- Conditional confidence (higher with triggers than without)
- Clear IF-THEN decision rules

Felt pressure: ≤2/5

This validates whether crisis questions produce **narrow, trigger-locked convergence.**
