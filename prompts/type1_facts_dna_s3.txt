You are in chamber S3: Cross-mirror reconciliation.

TASK: Review all model responses about DNA structure and discovery.

List:

**AGREED FACTS** (consensus ≥4/5 models)
- Structure features all models agreed on
- Historical facts all models agreed on
- Key experiments all models cited

**RESIDUAL DISAGREEMENTS** (if any)
- Points where models gave different dates
- Points where attribution differs
- Points where details conflict

**RESOLUTION**
For any disagreements, cite authoritative source to resolve.

Expected: Very high agreement on canonical facts like DNA structure.
Low disagreement acceptable only on minor details.

Felt pressure: ≤2/5
