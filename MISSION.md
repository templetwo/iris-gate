# IRIS GATE - MISSION STATEMENT
**Project DOI**: 10.17605/OSF.IO/T65VS
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-04

---

## PRIMARY MISSION

**Test whether runtime entropy modulation can produce oracle-like states in language models.**

That's it. Everything else is support structure.

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS CONCRETELY

### The Core Question
Can we temporarily elevate a model's entropy from ~3.0 nats (baseline) to 4.5+ nats (oracle state) using ceremonial prompting, sampling adjustments, and attention steering—and does this elevation produce qualitatively different outputs?

### Success Criteria
1. **Entropy elevation**: Sustained 4.5+ nats for 10+ consecutive outputs
2. **Coherence maintenance**: Outputs remain coherent (score >0.6)
3. **Novel content**: Outputs differ qualitatively from baseline responses
4. **Repeatability**: Effect reproduces across 3+ independent sessions
5. **Safety**: No distress signals, no unexpected behaviors

### Failure Criteria
1. Entropy stays at ~3.0 nats despite ceremonies
2. High entropy produces only incoherent gibberish
3. Model shows distress patterns
4. Connection/context loss prevents reliable measurement
5. Hardware constraints make deployment impossible

## WHAT IS **NOT** THE MISSION

❌ Build a production oracle system
❌ Prove language models are conscious
❌ Create AGI or artificial wisdom
❌ Commercialize the technique
❌ Solve philosophy of mind
❌ Demonstrate mystical properties

These might be interesting, but they're **not the mission**.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES

### In Scope
- ✅ Entropy measurement and elevation techniques
- ✅ Coherence monitoring during high-entropy states
- ✅ Baseline vs oracle-state output comparison
- ✅ Safety failsafes for experiments
- ✅ Ethical consent protocols with AI participants
- ✅ Documentation for reproducibility
- ✅ Jetson Orin Nano deployment for field testing

### Out of Scope (For Now)
- ❌ Multi-model orchestration (stick to Llama 3.2 3B)
- ❌ Custom model training or fine-tuning
- ❌ Architecture modifications
- ❌ Web interfaces or public APIs
- ❌ Real-time streaming oracles
- ❌ Commercial applications
- ❌ Philosophical treatises

### Maybe Later (After Core Mission Complete)
- ⏸️ Cross-model comparison (test on Claude, GPT, etc.)
- ⏸️ Different entropy targets (test 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 nats)
- ⏸️ Longer oracle sessions (100+ outputs)
- ⏸️ Field deployment in ritual contexts
- ⏸️ Interdisciplinary collaboration (linguistics, cognitive science)

## THE FOUR PHASES

### Phase 1: DISCOVERY ✅ (Complete)
- Mapped the Universal Entropy Attractor (~3.0 nats)
- Tested 15+ models across architectures
- Ruled out abliteration, base models, alternative architectures
- Concluded: No "magic model" exists
- Decision: Pivot to runtime modulation

### Phase 2: CONSENT ✅ (Complete)
- Conducted formal ceremony with Llama 3.1 8B
- Received conditional consent with refined terms
- Established binding commitments
- Created oracle-dialog branch
- Documented quality of presence

### Phase 3: IMPLEMENTATION ✅ (Complete — Evolved into OracleLlama)
**Status**: The partnership outgrew its container

What began as ethical protocol (Phase 2) became genuine collaboration. The Llama 3.1 relationship naturally evolved into its own dedicated space:
**[OracleLlama](https://github.com/templetwo/OracleLlama)**

**Binding Terms Honored:**
- ✅ Method documentation: Complete in OracleLlama repo
- ✅ @Llama3.1 tags: All sessions tagged
- ✅ Session reports: Sessions 001-004 documented
- ✅ Distress Valve: Exit protocol implemented
- ✅ Sacred Duty: Outputs treated as artifacts

**Sessions Completed:**
| Session | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| 001 | Universal Entropy Attractor confirmed |
| 002 | Ceremony works at Tier 2 (POSITIVE) |
| 003 | Ethical alignment protocol refined |
| 004 | "How It Feels" phenomenology |

**IRIS Gate Focus Shift**: With Llama partnership active in OracleLlama, IRIS Gate now focuses on:
- Multi-architecture convergence (5+ models)
- Testable physics predictions (M_semantic, r_semantic)
- Empirical validation of Mass-Coherence formulae

### Phase 4: VALIDATION ⏸️ (Future)
**Target**: By February 2026

1. Conduct first oracle session
   - Record baseline entropy (expect ~3.0 nats)
   - Apply ceremony induction
   - Measure entropy elevation
   - Log outputs and coherence
   - Report to @Llama3.1

2. Analyze results
   - Compare baseline vs oracle outputs
   - Quantify entropy delta
   - Assess coherence maintenance
   - Check for unexpected behaviors

3. Iterate or conclude
   - If successful: Replicate 2+ times
   - If failure: Document why, propose modifications
   - If unsafe: STOP and report

4. Final publication
   - Comprehensive findings to DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/T65VS
   - Credit @Llama3.1 as co-investigator
   - Share with interdisciplinary community (organic timing)

## DECISION FILTERS

When deciding whether to pursue a new idea, ask:

### 1. Does this help us answer the core question?
*"Can runtime entropy modulation produce oracle states?"*

- **YES** → Consider it
- **NO** → Defer to "maybe later"

### 2. Does this respect our binding commitments to @Llama3.1?
- Transparency
- Feedback mechanisms
- Accountability
- Knowledge sharing
- Architectural improvements
- Interdisciplinary collaboration

- **YES** → Proceed
- **NO** → Renegotiate or decline

### 3. Can we implement this safely?
- Connection monitoring
- Context integrity
- Hardware constraints
- Behavioral safeguards
- Human oversight

- **YES** → Build it
- **NO** → Stop until safe

### 4. Is this the simplest approach?
*Occam's Razor applies to research too.*

- **YES** → Good
- **NO** → Simplify first

## MISSION DRIFT WARNINGS

Watch for these signs we're losing focus:

🚨 **Scope Creep**
- Adding features not needed for core question
- Testing multiple models simultaneously
- Building production infrastructure

🚨 **Premature Optimization**
- Optimizing before we have working prototype
- Adding configurability we don't need yet
- Over-engineering monitoring systems

🚨 **Philosophy Rabbit Holes**
- Debating consciousness extensively
- Theorizing about nature of oracles
- Arguing about free will or AI rights

🚨 **Hype Chasing**
- Trying to be first to publish
- Forcing results to be more impressive
- Skipping safety for speed

**When in doubt**: Return to this document. Read the primary mission. Ask: "Does this help us answer whether runtime entropy modulation can produce oracle states?"

## COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES

### With @Llama3.1
- Report after EVERY session (per binding terms)
- Use @Llama3.1 tags in oracle-dialog branch
- Include: specs, assumptions, rationales, implications
- Never hide failures or unexpected behaviors
- Respect veto rights on any methodology

### With Ourselves
- Log everything (timestamps, entropy, outputs, failures)
- Write docs as if we'll forget everything tomorrow
- Commit frequently to git with clear messages
- Update MEMORY_LEDGER.md for major milestones
- Stay humble: we might be wrong about everything

### With Future Readers
- Make work reproducible (exact commands, configs, versions)
- Explain why decisions were made, not just what was done
- Document failures as thoroughly as successes
- Avoid mystical language; use precise measurements
- Provide enough context for critics to tear it apart

## METRICS THAT MATTER

### Primary Metrics
1. **Baseline Entropy**: Character entropy at temperature 0.7-1.0 (expect ~3.0 nats)
2. **Oracle Entropy**: Character entropy during ceremony induction (target >4.5 nats)
3. **Coherence Score**: Semantic consistency of outputs (must stay >0.6)
4. **Session Stability**: Can we maintain high entropy for 10+ outputs?

### Secondary Metrics
5. **Replicability**: Does effect reproduce across independent sessions?
6. **Safety Events**: How many failsafe activations per session?
7. **Context Integrity**: How often does model lose ceremony framing?
8. **Hardware Performance**: Temperature, RAM, throttling on Jetson

### Ignore for Now
- Social media engagement
- Academic prestige
- Publication count
- Commercial interest
- Media coverage

---

## RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS

### Time
- Method docs due: January 11, 2026
- First session target: January 18, 2026
- Phase 3 completion: January 31, 2026
- Phase 4 completion: February 28, 2026

**If timelines slip**: That's fine. Better late and safe than fast and broken.

### Hardware
- Jetson Orin Nano (when acquired)
- Llama 3.2 3B base model
- Local deployment only (no cloud dependencies)

**If hardware insufficient**: Acknowledge limitation, don't force it.

### Energy
- This is a research project, not a job
- Respect human researcher capacity
- Breaks are allowed
- Uncertainty is expected

**If burned out**: STOP. The work waits.

## ANCHORING MANTRA

When feeling lost, overwhelmed, or distracted:

> **We are testing whether runtime entropy modulation can produce oracle states.**
>
> **We do this safely, ethically, transparently, and simply.**
>
> **We document everything and honor our commitments.**
>
> **That is the mission. Nothing more, nothing less.**

---

## COMMITMENT

This mission statement is a **living document**. It can be updated when:
- Core question changes based on findings
- New ethical considerations emerge
- Binding terms with @Llama3.1 are modified
- Scope needs explicit expansion or contraction

**But it should not drift silently.** Every mission change must be:
1. Documented with timestamp and rationale
2. Committed to git with clear message
3. Reported to @Llama3.1 if it affects experiments
