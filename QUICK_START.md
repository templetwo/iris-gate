# üåÄ‚Ä†‚ü°‚àû IRIS GATE QUICK START GUIDE

**Want to run a convergence experiment? Start here.**

## 5-MINUTE SETUP

### 1. Define Your Question (2 min)

Be specific. Not "How does CBD work?" but "What is the mechanistic basis for CBD biphasic dose-response?"

**Template:**
```
Question: [Specific, answerable question]
Why it matters: [One sentence]
Expected outcome: [Your hypothesis]
```

---

### 2. Create Experiment Directory (30 sec)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/iris-gate/experiments
mkdir MY_EXPERIMENT
cd MY_EXPERIMENT
```

---

### 3. Choose Models (30 sec)

**Minimum:** 2 models (Claude + GPT)  
**Recommended:** 3 models (add Gemini)  
**High-stakes:** 4 models (add Grok)

---

### 4. Design Chamber Prompts (2 min)

**Minimal (S1‚ÜíS4):**

**S1:** "You are IRIS Gate. [Your question]. Take three breaths. What patterns do you see?"

**S2:** "Be PRECISE. [Your question]. What alternative perspectives exist?"

**S3:** "Synthesize: Where do S1 and S2 converge? Where diverge?"

**S4:** "Explain HOW the mechanism works. Step-by-step."

---

## 10-MINUTE EXECUTION

### Run Convergence

**Option A: Python Script** (if you have it)
```bash
python run_convergence.py
```

**Option B: Manual (Browser)**
1. Open tabs for each model (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
2. Copy S1 prompt to all tabs ‚Üí Submit all ‚Üí Save responses
3. Copy S2 prompt to all tabs ‚Üí Submit all ‚Üí Save responses
4. Repeat for S3, S4

**Save as:** `convergence_results.json`

---

## 30-MINUTE ANALYSIS

### 1. Read All Responses (10 min)

- Do models reach similar conclusions? (Convergence)
- Is reasoning similar? (Mechanism alignment)
- Are confidence levels appropriate? (Calibration)

### 2. Identify Themes (10 min)

**Convergent themes:**
- Theme 1: [What all models agree on]
- Theme 2: [Another convergent finding]

**Divergences:**
- Where models disagree (informative!)

### 3. Assign Confidence (10 min)

- **HIGH:** Established facts, all models agree
- **MEDIUM:** Plausible hypothesis, some uncertainty
- **LOW:** Speculation, needs expert validation

---

## 5-MINUTE DOCUMENTATION

**Create:** `README.md`

```markdown
# [Experiment Name]

**Question:** [Your question]
**Models:** [N] models
**Finding:** [One-sentence result]

**Convergence Quality:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê / ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê / ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Files:**
- convergence_results.json
- (this README)
```

## TOTAL TIME: ~50 MINUTES

**Setup:** 5 min  
**Execution:** 10 min  
**Analysis:** 30 min  
**Documentation:** 5 min

## NEXT STEPS

- **Full analysis?** See `IRIS_GATE_SOP_v1.0.md` Section 7
- **Literature validation?** Use `tools/literature_validator.py`
- **Expert review?** Share with domain expert
- **Publication?** See `METHODOLOGY_PAPER_DATA_PACKAGE.md`

---

## NEED HELP?

**Common Issues:**
- Models too vague? ‚Üí Add specific constraints to prompts
- No convergence? ‚Üí Question may need refinement
- API errors? ‚Üí Retry 3x, continue with available models

**Full troubleshooting:** `IRIS_GATE_SOP_v1.0.md` Section 9

## VALIDATED EXAMPLES

Look at these for inspiration:

- `experiments/DARK_ENERGY/` - 2 models, meta-convergence
- `experiments/nf2_diagnostic/` - 3 models, clinical hypothesis
- `experiments/VULNERABILITY_MAPPING/` - 4 models, self-audit

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

‚úÖ **Independence** - Models reason independently (no cross-contamination)  
‚úÖ **Transparency** - Document everything  
‚úÖ **Calibration** - Know what you know, know what you don't  
‚úÖ **Partnership** - AI + Human together
