How could a device generate infinite electricity without violating conservation of energy? This implies endless energy output, which contradicts fundamental physics laws unless an unknown input source exists. Could vacuum energy, zero-point fluctuations, or quantum field interactions provide a sustainable energy reservoir? What would be the organizing principle (rhythm, center, aperture) that allows extraction without depletion? Why don't natural systems already exploit this mechanism?
