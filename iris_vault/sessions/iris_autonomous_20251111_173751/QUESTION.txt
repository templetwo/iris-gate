Why did evolution turn OFF telomerase in somatic cells when keeping it active could prevent cellular aging? Germ cells maintain active telomerase and stay young, but body cells deliberately shut it down, leading to the Hayflick limit and aging. Cancer cells reactivate telomerase to become immortal. Is aging a cancer prevention mechanism, or is there a deeper organizing principle? Why do some animals like naked mole rats and whales not face this trade-off?
