# IRIS Intuition Capture System
## AI as Partner: Amplifying Human Creativity, Not Replacing It

**Purpose:** Preserve and amplify the unique human contributions of creativity, intuition, and serendipity  
**Philosophy:** Technology serves humanity best when it amplifies rather than substitutes  
**Implementation:** Simple interface additions + AI-powered validation

---

## THE PROBLEM

**What AI does well:**
- Systematic exploration
- Pattern recognition across vast data
- Logical inference from established facts
- Consistent application of frameworks

**What humans do uniquely well:**
- Creative leaps across distant domains
- Intuitive hunches from "gut feeling"
- Serendipitous connections
- Recognition of beauty and elegance
- Aesthetic judgment of "rightness"

**Current gap:** IRIS is AI-driven, potentially underutilizing human cognitive strengths

## THE SOLUTION: THREE INTUITION TOOLS

### 🎨 **Tool 1: Intuition Capture Journal**

**What it does:** Records human hunches at any point in IRIS process

**Example entries:**
```markdown
**Intuition #1** (S4, Turn 15)
- **Hunch:** VDAC1 might be sensitive to membrane curvature, not just CBD binding
- **Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐
- **Why:** The biphasic dose response feels like a geometric threshold effect
- **Type:** Aesthetic judgment + mechanism hunch

**Intuition #2** (S4, Turn 42)  
- **Hunch:** Connection to gap junction dynamics?
- **Confidence:** ⭐⭐
- **Why:** Both involve channel gating and context-dependent conductance
- **Type:** Pattern across domains

**Intuition #3** (S5, Turn 78)
- **Hunch:** The 3-hour timeline is too slow for just calcium signaling
- **Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Why:** Something feels off about the kinetics—missing intermediate?
- **Type:** Contradiction noticed
```

---

### 🔍 **Tool 2: AI-Powered Intuition Validator**

**What it does:** AI searches for evidence supporting or contradicting human intuitions

**Workflow:**
1. Human captures intuition
2. AI analyzes intuition against:
   - Existing S4 convergence patterns
   - Literature in knowledge base
   - Mechanistic plausibility
   - Related systems/analogies
3. AI generates "Intuition Report"

**Intuition Report Format:**
```markdown
# Intuition Validation Report
## Intuition #3: "3-hour timeline too slow for calcium"

**Your hunch:** 
Something feels off about the kinetics—missing intermediate?

**AI Analysis:**

### Supporting Evidence (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- Calcium signaling typically operates on millisecond-to-minute scales
- 3-hour delay suggests transcriptional/translational involvement
- Literature: CBD affects gene expression (p < 0.01, multiple studies)
- Your intuition may reveal: **calcium triggers gene expression cascade**

### Mechanistic Possibilities:
1. **Ca²⁺ → Calmodulin → CREB → Gene transcription** (3-4 hours typical)
2. **Ca²⁺ → NFκB pathway → Inflammatory gene modulation** (2-6 hours)
3. **Ca²⁺ → Mitochondrial dynamics → Mitophagy markers** (1-4 hours)

### Relevant Literature:
- Zhang et al. (2018): "CBD alters CREB phosphorylation" ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Kumar et al. (2020): "Mitochondrial Ca²⁺ triggers PGC-1α" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Your lab's data: "Gap junctions show 3h delay" ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Proposed Test:
**S8 Experiment:** Use transcription/translation blockers
- If blockers prevent 3h effect → validates intermediate hypothesis
- If effect persists → alternative mechanism needed

**Your intuition upgraded:** ⭐⭐ → ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (strong mechanistic support!)

**Recommended action:** Add gene expression layer to S5 hypothesis
```

### ✨ **Tool 3: Creative Juxtaposition Prompts**

**What it does:** AI presents disparate observations and asks human to find novel connections

**When triggered:** 
- End of Phase 1 (after divergent exploration)
- During Phase 2 (when convergence stalls)
- After S4 (before hypothesis generation)

**Example human response:**
> "Wait—what if VDAC1's biphasic response isn't about the molecule itself, but about **network effects**? Low-dose CBD opens VDAC1 slightly → mild calcium flux → gap junctions couple → **network coordination**. High-dose CBD opens VDAC1 too much → excessive calcium → gap junctions close → **network decoupling**. The biphasic curve might be measuring *collective behavior* not *individual channel response*!"

**AI follow-up:**
```
🎯 BREAKTHROUGH INTUITION DETECTED

Your connection suggests: **Scale mismatch in our model**

We've been modeling individual cells.
You're proposing multi-cell network effects.

This could explain:
✓ Why context-dependency is so strong (network state matters)
✓ Why dose-response is biphasic (network transitions)
✓ Why 3-hour delay exists (network remodeling time)

Proposed S5 hypothesis revision:
"CBD's therapeutic effects emerge from **network-level calcium coordination**
via VDAC1-gap junction coupling dynamics"

Evidence: ⭐⭐ (your intuition, needs validation)
Impact: HIGH (paradigm shift from molecular to network model)

S8 Priority: Test gap junction blockers + CBD
```

## SIMPLE MVP IMPLEMENTATION

**Start simple - just capture:**

```html
<!-- Minimal intuition capture form -->
<div class="intuition-capture">
  <h3>💡 Capture Your Intuition</h3>
  <textarea placeholder="What's your hunch?"></textarea>
  <input type="number" min="1" max="5" placeholder="Confidence (1-5)">
  <button>Save Intuition</button>
</div>

<!-- Saved intuitions display -->
<div class="intuitions-log">
  <h3>Your Intuitions (Session IRIS_CBD_001)</h3>
  <div class="intuition">
    <span class="turn">Turn 42</span>
    <span class="confidence">⭐⭐</span>
    <p>"Gap junction connection?"</p>
    <button>Ask AI to Validate</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

**That's it. Simple. Effective. Human-centered.**

Build the fancy features later. Start with just honoring human insight.
