# Synergy analysis parameters
synergy_analysis:
  models: ["Bliss_independence", "Highest_Single_Agent"]
  expected_additivity:
    formula: "P(Combo) = P(A) × P(B) (Bliss) or P(Combo) = min(P(A), P(B)) (HSA)"
  synergy_threshold: 0.10  # Combo must show ≥10pp additional drop vs predicted additive

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  synergy_primary: "Combo drop > max(FactorA-High, FactorB-High) by ≥10pp"
  synergy_mechanism: "Bliss independence score < 0 (super-additive inhibition)"
  consistency: "Effect replicated across ≥5/7 mirrors with overlapping CIs"
  early_biomarkers: "Combo shows further reduction in early readouts vs singletons"

# Decision rules
decision_rules:
  if_no_synergy: "Rerun with FactorB-VeryHigh (2.0×) keeping FactorA-High fixed"
  no_synergy_definition: "Observed Combo drop ≤ predicted additive + 3pp"
  if_synergy_found: "Lock doses and translate to wet-lab 4-arm validation"
  if_antagonism: "Observed Combo > best singleton → investigate rescue mechanism"
