Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, indicating the amount of thermal energy unavailable to do work due to the inherent randomness and irreversibility of physical processes. In other words, as energy becomes dispersed and less organized, its potential to be converted into useful work decreases, leading to an increase in entropy.
