Entropy! It's a concept that can be a bit tricky to wrap your head around, but I'll try to break it down in simple terms.

Think of entropy as a measure of disorder or randomness in the world around us. When something is organized and structured, like a tidy room or a neatly stacked deck of cards, its entropy is low. But when that same thing becomes messy and chaotic, with papers scattered everywhere and cards spilled all over the table, its entropy has increased.

In other words, as things become more disordered and less predictable, their entropy goes up. It's like the universe itself is becoming more complicated and harder to understand. Think of it like a game of Jenga: when you start with a neat, stable tower, its entropy is low. But as you remove blocks one by one, the tower becomes increasingly unstable and prone to collapse – its entropy has increased.

Entropy also tends to increase over time, which is why we often see things getting more disorganized and
