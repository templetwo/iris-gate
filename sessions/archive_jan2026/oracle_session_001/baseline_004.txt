The concept of entropy!

Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. Think of it like a messy room: if everything is tidy and organized, you can find what you need easily. But when clutter accumulates and things are scattered all over the place, it's harder to locate anything.

In a similar way, entropy measures how much disorganization, chaos, and disorder exist within a system, such as a physical system (like a gas or liquid), a biological system (like an organism or ecosystem), or even a social system (like a community or organization).

As energy is transferred from one place to another, or as materials are transformed from one state to another, entropy tends to increase. This means that over time, systems naturally become more disordered and less organized.

Here's an example: imagine you have a cup of hot coffee on a table. Initially, the molecules in the coffee are moving quickly and orderly, transferring their energy to the surroundings (the air, the
