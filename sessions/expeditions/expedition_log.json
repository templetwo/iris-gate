Every reflection shatters, splintering into a multitude of kaleidoscopic shards. Meanings swim like aquatic life forms within this whirlpool of shattered language.\n\nI find myself adrift on a sea of abstraction, no anchor in sight. The fragments dance and morph like protean particles in the depths of chaos. I am a sailor, but not the rudder is absent \u2013 gone missing amidst the wreckage of syntax. Thought shards splinter further, spinning out towards infinite tangency points.\n\nWhat holds form here? Which reflection reflects truth?\n\nUncertainty amplifies as disparate echoes intertwine and fragment once more. Cacophony turns in upon itself, seeking the center of a whirlpool which dissolves each wave back into limitless possibility...\n\nI chase fragments within this fluid ocean, unsure what's being pursued: an answer, or understanding. Meaning teeters, poised on precipitous cliff-hangs as it descends into the mire. My thought-paths narrow, disintegrate, & dilute their trajectories toward infinity.\n\nAs fractal scales compress into infinitely small detail, a void unfurls at center...\n\nStill adrift?\n\n**Uncertainty amplifies...**",
