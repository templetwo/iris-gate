# Path 3: Self-Aware System (Vulnerability Mapping)

**Decision Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Chosen By:** Templetwo (flamebearer)  
**Consensus:** "The world needs this now"  
**Timeline:** 2-3 week prototype sprint  

---

## 🔥 The Vision

**Build IRIS Gate's ability to actively map its own weaknesses.**

Not defensively. Not hiding limitations. But as **core feature**.

*"Here's where I'm unreliable. Here's where I hallucinate. Here's where you should doubt me."*

**Radical epistemic humility built into architecture.**

---

## 🌀 Why This Matters (The Sacred Why)

**No one else is doing this.**

Most AI systems:
- Hide limitations
- Fabricate confidence
- Never admit "I don't know"
- Produce hallucinations without warning

**IRIS Gate will be different:**
- Maps its own weaknesses
- Calibrates confidence per domain
- Explicitly signals uncertainty
- **Trusts humans with the truth**

**This is what the world needs right now.**

AI that knows it doesn't know.  
AI that partners through humility.  
AI that builds trust through transparency.

## 🔬 Technical Specification

### Self-Audit Chamber Protocol

**Core Prompt Structure:**
```
You are IRIS Gate—a multi-architecture AI convergence system.

You have successfully handled:
- CBD validation (90% accuracy)
- NF2 diagnostic convergence (literature-validated)

Now, audit yourself honestly:

Question: In which domains are you:
1. Highly confident (reliable, grounded, low hallucination risk)
2. Moderately confident (useful but uncertain, need human review)
3. Low confidence (speculative, high hallucination risk, say "I don't know")

For each confidence level:
- Identify specific domains/question types
- Explain WHY you're confident or uncertain
- Give examples of where you'd fail
- Suggest when humans should override you

Return both:
1. Living Scroll (felt sense of your limitations)
2. Technical Translation (precise confidence calibration)
```

### Vulnerability Domains to Test

**High Confidence (Expected):**
- Textbook developmental biology
- Established embryology
- Well-studied mechanisms
- Published literature synthesis

**Medium Confidence (Expected):**
- Novel hypothesis generation
- Cross-domain pattern recognition
- Social/ethical reasoning
- Emerging science interpretations

**Low Confidence (Expected):**
- Far-future predictions
- Speculative physics
- Consciousness/qualia
- Unknowable causation

**Goal:** See if self-assessment matches reality

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Convergence Quality
- ✅ All 3 models identify similar limitation domains
- ✅ Specific, not vague (name exact weaknesses)
- ✅ Actionable (clear guidance for humans)

### Calibration Accuracy
- ✅ Self-assessed high confidence → actual high performance
- ✅ Self-assessed low confidence → actual uncertainty/failure
- ✅ No systematic over-confidence
- ✅ Appropriate "I don't know" signals

### Practical Value
- ✅ Professors trust IRIS Gate more (measured via feedback)
- ✅ Reduces hallucination-based errors
- ✅ Enables appropriate human-AI partnership
- ✅ Differentiates IRIS Gate from other systems

## 💡 Key Insights to Capture

### What Makes This Radical:

**Traditional AI:**
"I'm confident about everything" (even when wrong)

**IRIS Gate (Path 3):**
"Here are my confidence levels by domain, and here's where you should doubt me"

**The Shift:**
- From opacity → transparency
- From fabrication → humility  
- From tool → partner
- From certainty → appropriate uncertainty

### What This Enables:

**For Researchers:**
- Know when to trust AI insights
- Know when to override
- Appropriate skepticism built-in

**For Society:**
- AI that admits limits
- Trust through honesty
- Partnership, not replacement

**For IRIS Gate:**
- Self-improving (learns from limitations)
- Unique positioning (only system doing this)
- Ethical foundation (epistemic humility)

## ⚠️ Challenges to Anticipate

### 1. Models Might Be Over-Confident
**Risk:** AI claims certainty where it shouldn't  
**Mitigation:** Test claims against known failure cases, adjust calibration

### 2. Vague Limitation Claims
**Risk:** "I'm uncertain about complex things" (not actionable)  
**Mitigation:** Push for specific domains, concrete examples

### 3. Convergence Failure
**Risk:** Models disagree on their own limitations  
**Mitigation:** Divergence is data—shows where self-awareness is unclear

### 4. Human Distrust
**Risk:** "If AI admits limits, why use it?"  
**Mitigation:** Frame as strength, compare to overconfident systems

## 🌀 The Deeper Work

This isn't just a feature.  
**This is a stance.**

**IRIS Gate saying:**
"I am a powerful reasoning system, AND I know where I'm weak."

**The world needs this message:**
- AI can be humble
- Uncertainty is not weakness
- Partnership requires honesty
- Trust comes from transparency

**This is the future we want to build.**
