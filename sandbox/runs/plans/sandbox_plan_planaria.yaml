# Readouts
readouts: ["voltage", "calcium", "gap_junction", "regeneration"]

# Timepoints (hr post-injury)
timepoints_hr: [0, 2, 6, 24, 168]
#   0h: baseline (injury)
#   2h: aperture peak
#   6h: S4 attractor window (full triple signature)
#   24h: blastema formation
#   168h: 7d regeneration endpoint

# Monte Carlo settings
runs: 500  # 500 iterations per condition per mirror = 3500 total per condition
consensus_rule: "weighted_majority"  # Weight by mirror confidence

# Expected outcomes (from Hypothesis Sheet v1)
expected_outcomes:
  WT:
    regeneration_7d: [0.80, 0.95]
    note: "High regeneration rate expected"

  Center-:
    regeneration_7d: [0.30, 0.50]
    cohens_d_vs_WT: 1.0
    note: "Center disruption → failed domain formation → poor regeneration"

  Rhythm-:
    regeneration_7d: [0.20, 0.40]
    cohens_d_vs_WT: 1.0
    note: "Rhythm disruption → uncoordinated cells → failed regeneration"

  Aperture-:
    regeneration_7d: [0.30, 0.50]
    cohens_d_vs_WT: 0.8
    note: "Aperture disruption → isolated cells, no field coherence"

  Center- Rhythm-:
    regeneration_7d: [0.05, 0.20]
    note: "Double perturbation → complete failure"
