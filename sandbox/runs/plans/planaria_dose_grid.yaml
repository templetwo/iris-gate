# Fewer runs for dose grid (still 250 × 7 mirrors × 16 conditions = 28,000 sims)
runs: 250
consensus_rule: "weighted_majority"

# Expected outcomes
expected_outcomes:
  hypothesis: "IC50 occurs around 2-3× standard dose for each agent"
  interpretation: "If IC50 is higher, current doses too weak; if lower, model over-predicts perturbation effects"
