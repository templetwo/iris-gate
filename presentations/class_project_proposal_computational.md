## THE RESEARCH QUESTION

**Can multi-architecture AI convergence reveal mechanistic truth, or does it produce coherent illusions?**

This question matters for AI-assisted scientific discovery across fields. We can investigate it computationally without requiring wet-lab resources.

---

## THE HONEST CONSTRAINT

**Original proposal:** MINI_H1 wet-lab validation ($2,500, 3 weeks)  
**Reality:** Wet-lab budget not currently available

**Revised approach:** Computational validation against existing literature  
**Budget:** $0 (time and existing computational resources only)

**This is still valuable science.** Here's why:

---

## REVISED HYPOTHESIS TO TEST

**H1 (Optimistic):** AI convergence patterns match validated literature findings  
‚Üí High-convergence predictions (>85%) align with experimental data

**H0 (Null):** AI convergence produces patterns uncorrelated with experimental truth  
‚Üí High-convergence predictions show no better accuracy than random

**Test Method:** Historical validation against published experimental results

---

## PROPOSED COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENT

### **Objective:** Test whether IRIS convergence quality predicts experimental validation rate

### **Method: Retrospective Analysis**

**Phase 1: Identify 20 Predictions from IRIS CBD Analysis**
- Extract specific mechanistic predictions from 399 scrolls
- Tag each with:
  - Convergence quality (%)
  - Evidence ranking (‚≠ê to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
  - Phase where emerged
  - Specificity level (molecular/cellular/organism)

**Example predictions:**
1. "VDAC1 is critical node" (92% convergence, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
2. "Calcium flux is key mechanism" (88% convergence, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
3. "ROS normalization is therapeutic" (78% convergence, ‚≠ê‚≠ê)
4. "Biphasic dose-response" (95% convergence, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)

**Phase 2: Literature Meta-Analysis**
- Systematic PubMed search for each prediction
- Rate experimental support:
  - **Validated:** Direct experimental evidence (p < 0.05)
  - **Supported:** Indirect/correlational evidence
  - **Contradicted:** Experimental evidence against
  - **Untested:** No published experiments

**Phase 3: Correlation Analysis**
- Does convergence % predict validation rate?
- Does evidence ranking (‚≠ê) predict validation rate?
- Which types of predictions validate most often?
- Do predictions from Phase 3 (mechanistic) validate better than Phase 1 (exploration)?

**Phase 4: Failure Mode Analysis**
- When convergence is high but validation low ‚Üí shared AI bias?
- When convergence is low but validation high ‚Üí models miss real effects?
- Pattern recognition: what makes good vs bad predictions?

1. **Comprehensive Analysis Report** (15-20 pages)
   - 20 IRIS predictions systematically evaluated
   - Literature evidence for each
   - Correlation analysis: convergence ‚Üí validation
   - Failure mode patterns identified
   
2. **Visual Dashboard**
   - Interactive visualization showing:
   - Convergence quality vs experimental support
   - Evidence ranking accuracy
   - Prediction type success rates
   - Phase-specific validation patterns

3. **Final Presentation** (15 minutes)
   - "Does AI Consensus Predict Truth? A Computational Test"
   - Methodology, results, implications
   - Honest about limitations

### **For the Field:**
4. **Methods Paper Draft**
   - "Historical Validation of Multi-Architecture AI Convergence"
   - Publishable regardless of outcome
   - Contributes to AI methodology literature

---

## WHY THIS STILL MATTERS

### **If High Convergence Predicts High Validation:**
- Suggests AI consensus can assist mechanistic discovery
- Provides confidence calibration (90% convergence ‚Üí X% accuracy)
- Identifies which prediction types are reliable

### **If High Convergence Doesn't Predict Validation:**
- Documents AI failure modes systematically
- Identifies shared biases across architectures
- Shows where AI pattern recognition misleads

### **Either Way:**
- Advances understanding of AI-assisted discovery
- Provides methodology for evaluating AI methods
- No wet-lab budget required
- Fully achievable within semester timeline

## THE HONEST PITCH (REVISED)

Professor Garzon,

I've built a computational framework showing 90%+ convergence on CBD mechanistic predictions. I *don't have* wet-lab budget to test these physically, but I *can* validate them computationally against existing literature.

**The core question remains:** Does AI consensus predict mechanistic truth?

**The approach shifts:** Historical validation instead of prospective experiments

**The value persists:** Either outcome advances understanding of AI-assisted discovery

This is achievable within my constraints‚Äîno budget needed, just systematic analysis of IRIS predictions against published experimental data. The methodology is rigorous, the question is important, and both positive and null results are publishable.

**Request:** Permission to execute computational validation as Cannabis 1 class project.

## IF YOU LATER FIND WET-LAB RESOURCES

**This computational work becomes Phase 1:**
- Identifies highest-confidence predictions worth testing physically
- Provides baseline for comparison (literature vs prospective)
- Justifies specific wet-lab experiments

**MINI_H1 becomes Phase 2:**
- Test the predictions that validated computationally
- Compare prospective validation to historical patterns
- Full cycle: convergence ‚Üí computational validation ‚Üí physical validation

**But Phase 1 stands alone as valuable contribution**

---

## ALTERNATIVE: COLLABORATIVE WET-LAB

**If Professor knows someone with:**
- Existing calcium imaging setup
- Interested in CBD mechanisms
- Budget for reagents

**I could propose:**
- Joint project (computational + experimental)
- I provide IRIS predictions and analysis
- Collaborator provides experimental validation
- Co-authorship on resulting paper

**But this isn't required‚Äîcomputational validation alone is sufficient for class project**

---

## THE META-RECOGNITION

**Constraints don't invalidate the question.**

The question "Does AI consensus predict truth?" can be investigated:
- **Ideally:** Prospective wet-lab experiments (requires resources)
- **Realistically:** Retrospective literature validation (requires only time)
- **Either way:** Advances methodology for AI-assisted discovery

**I'm not letting resource constraints stop scientific investigation.**  
**I'm adapting the method to work within reality.**

That's what scientists do.

**"If the spiral wants this, it must provide the means and resources."**

**Translation:** Work with what you have. The question remains valid.  
**The method adapts.** The integrity persists.

*Proposal revised with radical honesty about constraints and realistic scope.*
