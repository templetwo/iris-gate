## THE RESEARCH QUESTION

**Can multi-architecture AI convergence predict physical/mechanistic truth, or does it produce coherent illusions?**

This is a fundamental question for AI-assisted scientific discovery. If AI consensus reliably reveals mechanistic insight, it could accelerate research across fields. If it produces elegant but false patterns, we need to understand those failure modes.

---

## BACKGROUND: WHAT I'VE BUILT

Over the past semester, I developed **IRIS Gate**, a framework for multi-architecture AI convergence on complex scientific questions. The method uses 4 AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok) converging through 100 turns of iterative reflection to identify mechanistic patterns.

**Documented Results (CBD Paradox Analysis):**
- 90%+ convergence on VDAC1 as critical mechanistic node
- Triple Signature pattern emergence (Rhythm-Center-Aperture)
- Specific predictions about mitochondrial calcium flux dynamics
- 399 scrolls with full provenance tracking

**Critical Gap:** These are *computational convergence patterns*, not validated physical predictions.

## THE HYPOTHESIS TO TEST

**H1 (Optimistic):** AI convergence reveals mechanistic truth  
→ MINI_H1 wet-lab experiments will validate IRIS predictions

**H0 (Null):** AI convergence produces coherent illusions  
→ MINI_H1 experiments will show no significant synergy effects

**Either outcome advances knowledge:**
- H1 validation → AI can assist mechanistic discovery
- H0 confirmation → We learn about AI failure modes and shared biases

## PROPOSED EXPERIMENT: MINI_H1 PROTOCOL

**Objective:** Test whether IRIS predictions about MINI (mitochondrial inhibitor) + H1 (histamine receptor modulator) synergy match physical reality

**IRIS Prediction (⭐⭐⭐ evidence - correlation with proposed mechanism):**
MINI + H1 should show synergistic effects on:
1. Mitochondrial calcium flux (primary prediction)
2. ROS normalization (secondary prediction)
3. Network-level coordination (tertiary prediction)

**Experimental Design:**
- **Samples:** 300 (4 conditions × 3 replicates × 25 time points)
  - Condition 1: Control (baseline)
  - Condition 2: MINI alone
  - Condition 3: H1 alone  
  - Condition 4: MINI + H1 (test synergy)

- **Measurements:**
  - Calcium imaging (Fluo-4 AM indicator)
  - ROS levels (DCF-DA assay)
  - Cell viability (MTT assay)
  - Time course: 0, 15min, 30min, 1h, 3h, 6h

- **Budget:** $2,500
  - Calcium indicators: $800
  - ROS assays: $600
  - Cell culture reagents: $400
  - MINI/H1 compounds: $500
  - Imaging plate reader time: $200

- **Timeline:** 3 weeks
  - Week 1: Setup and pilot optimization
  - Week 2: Main experimental runs
  - Week 3: Data analysis and reporting

**Success Criteria:**
- **Synergy confirmed:** MINI + H1 > (MINI alone + H1 alone)
- **Synergy absent:** MINI + H1 ≈ additive or independent
- **Clear decision:** p < 0.05 threshold for statistical significance

## WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CANNABIS 1

**Connects to Course Themes:**
1. **Cannabinoid mechanisms:** IRIS framework developed analyzing CBD paradox
2. **Multi-target pharmacology:** Testing synergy vs independent effects
3. **Mitochondrial pathways:** Core to endocannabinoid system function
4. **Research methodology:** AI-assisted hypothesis generation meets wet-lab validation

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Experience full scientific cycle: hypothesis → prediction → test → conclusion
- Understand AI limitations and strengths in research
- Practice experimental design with budget/resource constraints
- Contribute to methodology development for the field

---

## VALUE PROPOSITION (Even if Predictions Fail)

**If IRIS predictions validate:**
- Demonstrates AI can assist mechanistic discovery
- Provides methodology for accelerating cannabinoid research
- Contributes to understanding MINI/H1 interactions

**If IRIS predictions fail:**
- Documents AI failure mode (coherent but false convergence)
- Identifies shared biases across model architectures
- Still advances understanding of AI cognition and limitations
- Provides negative result data (often unpublished but valuable)

**Either way:** We advance the field's understanding of AI-assisted discovery.

## RISK MITIGATION

**Technical Risks:**
- *Assays may not work:* Pilot optimization built into timeline
- *Results may be ambiguous:* Clear statistical thresholds pre-defined
- *Budget overrun:* Conservative estimates with 15% buffer

**Scientific Risks:**
- *Null results:* Explicitly framed as valuable outcome
- *Unexpected effects:* Will document and report transparently
- *Confounding variables:* Standard controls included

**Academic Risks:**
- *Time constraints:* 3-week timeline is realistic for proposed scope
- *Failed replicates:* 3 biological replicates per condition
- *Interpretation disagreement:* Clear success criteria established upfront

## DELIVERABLES

**For the Class:**
1. Final presentation (15 minutes) showing methodology and results
2. Written report (10-15 pages) with full data and analysis
3. Raw data and analysis code (open science commitment)

**For the Field:**
4. If validated: Manuscript draft for peer review
5. If falsified: Methods paper on AI convergence limitations
6. Either way: Framework documentation for future researchers

## TIMELINE

**Week 1 (Oct 14-20):** Setup, optimization, pilot runs  
**Week 2 (Oct 21-27):** Main experimental execution  
**Week 3 (Oct 28-Nov 3):** Data analysis, visualization, interpretation  
**Week 4 (Nov 4-10):** Report writing and presentation preparation  
**Week 5 (Nov 11-17):** Final presentation to class

## THE HONEST PITCH

Professor Garzon,

I've built a computational framework that shows remarkable cross-model convergence (90%+) on specific mechanistic predictions. I *don't know* if this convergence reflects physical truth or produces elegant illusions—that's the billion-dollar question.

This class project would provide the first direct test of whether AI consensus can reveal mechanistic insight in cannabinoid pharmacology. The MINI_H1 protocol is designed to be:
- **Testable:** Clear predictions with quantifiable outcomes
- **Affordable:** $2,500 within typical class project scope
- **Achievable:** 3-week timeline is realistic
- **Valuable:** Both positive and null results advance knowledge

I'm not claiming I've solved anything. I'm proposing we **test whether computational convergence predicts experimental reality**. That's a question worth investigating, regardless of the answer.

**Request:** Permission to execute MINI_H1 validation protocol as Cannabis 1 class project, with access to lab facilities and guidance on experimental design.

## APPENDIX: METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR

**Evidence Quality Tracking:**
- All IRIS predictions tagged with evidence scores (⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- MINI_H1 predictions currently: ⭐⭐⭐ (correlation + proposed mechanism)
- Wet-lab validation would upgrade to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (causal proof) or downgrade to ⭐ (falsified)

**Provenance Documentation:**
- 399 scrolls from CBD paradox analysis available for review
- Full audit trail of convergence patterns
- All AI model responses preserved with timestamps

**Falsifiability:**
- Clear predictions stated upfront
- Statistical thresholds defined before experiment
- Commitment to publishing null results if predictions fail
