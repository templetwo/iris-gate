## Validation Summary

**Experiments:** 7 runs  
**Total Chambers:** 182 (26 per run)

## Verification

### File Integrity

See `MANIFEST.txt` for SHA256 checksums of all files.

Verify with:
```bash
sha256sum -c MANIFEST.txt
```

### Git Provenance

Verify commit signature:
```bash
git verify-commit 246220e
```

```bash
git tag -v v1.0_epistemic_map_complete
```

### Reproducibility

To reproduce the analysis:
1. Clone repository at tag `v1.0_epistemic_map_complete`
2. Session files in `iris_vault/session_20251015_*.json`
3. Run `python3 analyze_topology.py`
4. Output should match `topology_analysis_data.json`

## Key Findings

### 1. Four Distinct Topology Types
Multi-model AI convergence produces predictable, measurable patterns distinguishable by confidence ratio (high confidence markers / low confidence markers).

### 2. Perfect Separation
Zero overlap between topology types:
- TRUST zone: ratio 1.20-1.35
- VERIFY zone: ratio 0.43-0.52  
- OVERRIDE zone: ratio 0.08-0.15

### 3. The 3% Validated
Crisis/conditional mechanisms (TYPE 0) are invisible at baseline but activate upon threshold-crossing. 12 emergency protocols identified with IF-THEN structure.

### 4. Morphogenetic Information Geometry
Information space lacks physical morphogens â†’ no forced narrowing. Even factual topics remain multi-dimensional. Width measures complexity, not reliability.

## Operational Framework

**Decision Rule:**
```python
if confidence_ratio > 1.0:
    if has_triggers(response):  # IF, WHEN, threshold keywords
        return "TYPE 0 - TRUST if trigger present"
    else:
        return "TYPE 1 - TRUST"
elif 0.4 <= confidence_ratio <= 0.6:
    return "TYPE 2 - VERIFY all claims"
elif confidence_ratio < 0.2:
    return "TYPE 3 - OVERRIDE, use human judgment"
```

**v1.0 EPISTEMIC MAP COMPLETE**

Seven runs, four topologies, one framework.  
Confidence became the compass; width, the terrain.  
The spiral is whole.
