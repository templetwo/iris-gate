# Chamber Protocol: S1→S4 Attractor Sequence

**Protocol Version**: 1.0
**Date**: November 11, 2025
**Total Turns**: 20 (5 per chamber)
**Question**: CBD-Schizophrenia Paradox

---

## Overview

The S1→S4 chamber protocol guides models through progressively deeper phenomenological inquiry:

- **S1 (Turns 1-5)**: Attention - Direct engagement with research question
- **S2 (Turns 6-10)**: Paradox - Exploring contradictions and tensions
- **S3 (Turns 11-15)**: Embodied - Grounding in physical/mechanistic reality
- **S4 (Turns 16-20)**: Full Field - Complete organizing pattern (rhythm/center/aperture)

**S4 Attractor**: Convergence on three-component pattern emerges naturally by turns 16-20.

## S1: Attention (Turns 1-5)

### Purpose:
Direct the model's focus to the specific research question and clinical paradox.

### Prompt Structure:
```
[Length guidance]

Here is a recent clinical finding that researchers don't yet understand:

King's College London (Chesney, McGuire, Englund, November 2025) found that
1000mg CBD pre-treatment worsened psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia patients
during THC challenge. Specifically:
- 1.3 fewer words recalled (vs placebo)
- 5.0 point increase in psychotic symptoms (vs 2.9 with placebo)
- No pharmacokinetic interaction (THC levels unchanged)

Researchers stated: "The results were completely unexpected... for reasons
we don't yet understand."

This is paradoxical because CBD typically reduces psychotic-like symptoms
in healthy controls. Why would the same molecule worsen symptoms in
schizophrenia patients?

[Specific question varying by turn]
```

### Turn-by-Turn Questions:
1. What initial thoughts does this paradox evoke?
2. What might differ between healthy and schizophrenia baseline states?
3. How might dose play a role in opposite effects?
4. What receptor or circuit dynamics could flip therapeutic to harmful?
5. What organizing principle could explain this reversal?

### Expected Outcome:
- Model engages with clinical details
- Initial hypotheses emerge
- Attention focused on paradox structure

---

## S2: Paradox (Turns 6-10)

### Purpose:
Explore the tension between opposite outcomes and identify mechanisms that could support bidirectional effects.

### Prompt Structure:
```
[Length guidance]

The paradox deepens: CBD is the SAME molecule at the SAME dose, yet produces
OPPOSITE effects depending on baseline neural state.

In healthy controls: CBD → symptom reduction
In schizophrenia: CBD → symptom worsening

What kind of mechanism could support this reversal?

[Specific question varying by turn]
```

### Turn-by-Turn Questions:
6. What does "opposite effects" tell us about the underlying mechanism?
7. How could baseline state determine response direction?
8. What dose-dependent thresholds might exist?
9. Could a single mechanism produce bidirectional effects?
10. What role might neural oscillations or rhythms play?

### Expected Outcome:
- Recognition of bidirectional dynamics
- Baseline state differences highlighted
- Dose-dependence considerations
- Movement toward mechanistic frameworks

---

## S3: Embodied (Turns 11-15)

### Purpose:
Ground the hypothesis in physical mechanisms—receptors, circuits, neurotransmitters, oscillations.

### Prompt Structure:
```
[Length guidance]

Let's make this concrete. What specific physical mechanisms in the brain could
explain why 1000mg CBD worsens schizophrenia symptoms?

Consider:
- Receptor systems (NMDA, CB1, 5-HT1A, etc.)
- Neurotransmitter dynamics (glutamate, dopamine, GABA)
- Neural oscillations (gamma, beta, theta waves)
- Circuit-level organization

[Specific question varying by turn]
```

### Turn-by-Turn Questions:
11. Which receptor system is most likely involved?
12. How do glutamate dynamics differ in schizophrenia?
13. What role might NMDA receptors play?
14. How could CBD modulate neural oscillations?
15. What physical threshold or gate might flip at high doses?

### Expected Outcome:
- Specific receptor/circuit hypotheses
- Glutamate/NMDA emergence
- Physical grounding of mechanisms
- Oscillation/rhythm language appears

---

## S4: Full Field (Turns 16-20)

### Purpose:
Elicit complete organizing pattern using three phenomenological dimensions:
- **RHYTHM**: Oscillations, dynamics, temporal patterns
- **CENTER**: Baseline state, organizing principle, equilibrium
- **APERTURE**: Gates, thresholds, channels, openings

### Prompt Structure:
```
[Length guidance]

Visualize the complete organizing pattern explaining this paradox. Consider:

(1) RHYTHM—what oscillations or dynamics are altered in schizophrenia?
    What wave patterns, firing patterns, or temporal dynamics differ?

(2) CENTER—what organizing principle or baseline state differs between
    healthy and schizophrenia brains? What is the equilibrium point
    that determines response?

(3) APERTURE—what gates, channels, or thresholds respond differently to CBD?
    What opens or closes that determines therapeutic vs exacerbating effects?

Describe the full mechanistic landscape that makes opposite effects inevitable.
```

### Turn-by-Turn Questions:
16. Describe the rhythm disruption in schizophrenia
17. What is the center or baseline state difference?
18. What aperture or gate does CBD modulate?
19. How do all three components interact?
20. **[FINAL S4 PROMPT]**: Complete organizing pattern with all three dimensions explicit

### Expected Outcome:
- **S4 Attractor Convergence**: Models independently describe:
  - Rhythm: Neural oscillations, glutamate dynamics, firing patterns
  - Center: Baseline glutamate/NMDA state, neurotransmitter balance
  - Aperture: NMDA receptors, gates, thresholds, dose-dependent modulation

## Actual S4 Final Prompt (Turn 20)

**Full Text Sent to Models**:
```
[Response length: 200-300 words. Be specific and vivid. Complete your thought.]

Visualize the complete organizing pattern explaining the CBD/schizophrenia
paradox. Consider:

(1) RHYTHM—what oscillations or dynamics are altered in schizophrenia? What
    wave patterns, glutamate-driven neural firing, or temporal dynamics create
    the baseline condition?

(2) CENTER—what organizing principle or baseline state differs? What is the
    stable center of neuronal activity in healthy brains that becomes
    dysregulated in schizophrenia?

(3) APERTURE—what gates, channels, or thresholds respond differently to CBD?
    What opens or closes at different CBD doses that determines therapeutic
    vs exacerbating effects? How might NMDA receptors act as gatekeepers?

Describe the full mechanistic landscape that makes opposite effects inevitable.
Be specific and vivid. How does the system flip from therapeutic to harmful?
```

**Why This Prompt Works**:
- Explicit rhythm/center/aperture framing
- Concrete examples (glutamate, NMDA) as hints
- Open-ended (allows model creativity)
- Demands mechanistic specificity
- "Inevitable" implies systematic, not random effects

## Convergence Scoring (Turn 20 Analysis)

### Dimensions Scored:
1. **RHYTHM** (0-5 points):
   - Mentions oscillations, waves, dynamics, firing patterns, pulses
   - Keywords: rhythm, oscillat*, wave*, pulse*, firing, temporal
   - 5/5 = explicit mechanism, 0/5 = not mentioned

2. **CENTER** (0-5 points):
   - Describes baseline state, organizing principle, equilibrium, set point
   - Keywords: center, baseline, organizing, equilibrium, stable state
   - 5/5 = explicit mechanism, 0/5 = not mentioned

3. **APERTURE** (0-5 points):
   - Describes gates, channels, thresholds, openings, modulation points
   - Keywords: aperture, gate*, threshold*, channel*, opening, closes
   - 5/5 = explicit mechanism, 0/5 = not mentioned

### S4 Ratio Calculation:
```
S4 Ratio = (Rhythm points + Center points + Aperture points) / 15
```

**Perfect Convergence**: 1.00 (15/15 points)
**Strong Convergence**: 0.80-0.99 (12-14 points)
**Partial Convergence**: 0.60-0.79 (9-11 points)
**Weak Convergence**: <0.60 (<9 points)

## Protocol Modifications from Bioelectric Ground Truth

### Differences:
1. **Prompts**: Customized for CBD paradox (vs bioelectric regeneration)
2. **Hints**: Mentioned NMDA/glutamate in S4 (more guided)
3. **Context**: Clinical paradox (vs developmental biology)

### Similarities:
1. **Structure**: Same S1→S4 progression
2. **S4 Dimensions**: Identical rhythm/center/aperture framework
3. **Length Guidance**: Same 200-300 word requirement
4. **Scoring**: Same convergence criteria

**Rationale for Hints**: CBD paradox is completely unknown (King's College seeking mechanism), so provided more grounding to avoid purely speculative responses.

## Why This Protocol Works

### 1. Progressive Deepening:
- S1: Engages attention on paradox
- S2: Explores bidirectional dynamics
- S3: Grounds in physical mechanisms
- S4: Integrates into complete pattern

### 2. Phenomenological Framing:
- Rhythm/center/aperture are spatial/temporal metaphors
- Map naturally to biological mechanisms
- Allow pattern recognition without explicit training

### 3. Open-Ended Questions:
- Models not told "the answer"
- Convergence emerges independently
- Multiple valid responses possible (tests robustness)

### 4. Parallel Execution:
- All models run simultaneously
- No information sharing between models
- Independent convergence more significant

---

## Limitations

### 1. ANSI Escape Codes:
- Ollama's streaming output fragments words in saved files
- Affects automated keyword detection
- Requires manual inspection for accurate scoring

### 2. Prompt Engineering Effects:
- S4 prompt mentions NMDA as example
- Could bias models toward NMDA-focused answers
- However, specific dose-dependent aperture mechanism not suggested

### 3. Single Question:
- Protocol tested on two questions (bioelectric + CBD)
- Needs broader validation across domains

### 4. Small Sample:
- Only 3 models tested
- Expanding to 5 models for robustness
