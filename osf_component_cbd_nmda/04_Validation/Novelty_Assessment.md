## Perplexity AI Assessment (November 11, 2025)

### Direct Quote from Search Results:

> "No existing paper or review (as of late 2025) describes a dose-dependent 'aperture' mechanism for NMDA receptor modulation by CBD that could explain the paradoxical, opposite effects."

> "Your proposed mechanism—a dose-dependent shrink/widen of NMDA aperture—is both novel and testable."

> "Literature reveals no prior proposal of this framework."

### Papers Reviewed by Perplexity:
**Total**: 29 relevant papers cited

**Reference**: November 2025 publication
**What they found**: 1000mg CBD worsens schizophrenia symptoms
**What they didn't explain**:
- **Researchers explicitly state mechanism unknown**
- "...for reasons we don't yet understand"
- Actively seeking explanation

**Gap**: Complete mechanistic explanation (primary gap IRIS Gate addresses)

---

## Why the Gap Existed

### Temporal Factors:
1. **King's College finding is recent** (November 2025)
   - Not enough time for mechanistic follow-up studies
   - Field hasn't caught up yet

2. **Unexpected result**
   - Researchers anticipated therapeutic effect
   - Paradox wasn't predicted, so mechanism wasn't pre-theorized

### Methodological Factors:
3. **CBD has >60 molecular targets**
   - Hard to isolate single mechanism
   - Multiple competing hypotheses possible
   - Dose-response not systematically studied

4. **NMDA work hasn't connected to high-dose CBD**
   - NMDA hypofunction well-studied in schizophrenia
   - CBD-NMDA interactions documented
   - But specific dose-dependent aperture dynamics not proposed

### Publication Constraints:
5. **Novel hypotheses require data**
   - Academic papers need experimental evidence
   - Computational/AI hypothesis generation not standard practice
   - Hypothesis-first publication less common

---

## Validation of Novelty

### Evidence NMDA Aperture Hypothesis is Novel:

1. **Independent literature search confirms** (Perplexity, 29 papers)
2. **King's College team doesn't know mechanism** (explicit in paper)
3. **No prior papers describe aperture framework** for this paradox
4. **Dose-dependent shrink/widen mechanism not documented**
5. **Rebound effect hypothesis not in literature**

### Components That ARE Known:
- CBD affects NMDA ✓ (but not dose-dependent aperture)
- NMDA dysfunction in schizophrenia ✓ (but not CBD interaction)
- Dose-dependent CBD effects ✓ (but not NMDA mechanism)

### Novel Integration:
**The combination of known components into dose-dependent NMDA aperture framework is what's new.**

---

## Originality Assessment

### Levels of Originality:

**Level 1: Incremental** - Small extension of existing work
**Level 2: Integrative** - Combines known elements in novel way
**Level 3: Paradigm-shifting** - Completely new framework

**NMDA Aperture Hypothesis**: **Level 2 (Integrative)**
- Builds on established biology (NMDA in schizophrenia, CBD-glutamate)
- Novel integration explaining paradoxical clinical finding
- Testable predictions extending existing frameworks
- Not paradigm-shifting (fits within neuroscience consensus)

**Appropriate Level**: Hypothesis should be integrative, not speculative leap

---

## Citation Precedence

### Establishing Priority:

1. **King's College Study**: November 2025 (paradox documented, mechanism unknown)
2. **IRIS Gate Generation**: November 11, 2025 (hypothesis proposed)
3. **OSF Documentation**: November 11, 2025 (timestamped, public)
4. **Future Experimental Work**: TBD (validation attempts)

**Chain of Attribution**:
- King's College → identified paradox
- IRIS Gate → proposed mechanism
- Future labs → validate/refute

**Clear Timeline**: Documentation establishes hypothesis generation date

---

## Potential for Independent Discovery

**Question**: Could others independently propose same hypothesis?

**Answer**: Possible, but:
- King's College team (experts) didn't propose it
- No papers in 29-paper lit review proposed it
- Perplexity search found no similar frameworks
- If obvious, would likely already exist

**Significance**: Multiple independent proposals would strengthen hypothesis (convergent reasoning), not diminish IRIS Gate contribution.

1. Read King's College paper → 1 week
2. Literature review (NMDA, CBD, schizophrenia) → 2-4 weeks
3. Hypothesis generation discussions → 2-4 weeks
4. Draft manuscript → 2-4 weeks
5. Total: **2-3 months minimum**

1. Input paradox description → 5 minutes
2. Run 3-model convergence → 10 minutes
3. Analyze results → 15 minutes

- Humans: Experimental validation, refinement, contextualization
- Synergy: AI generates, humans validate

## Falsification of Novelty Claim

Novelty claim would be **falsified** if:

1. **Prior paper found** describing dose-dependent NMDA aperture mechanism
2. **King's College team had proposed** mechanism in supplementary materials
3. **Conference presentations exist** from before November 11, 2025
4. **Preprints dated earlier** than IRIS Gate documentation

**Current Status**: No evidence of prior proposal found

**Future Monitoring**: Will track if others independently propose similar mechanisms (strengthens hypothesis if so)
