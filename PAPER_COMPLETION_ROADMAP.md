# IRIS Gate Methodology Paper - Completion Roadmap

**Current Status:** Main manuscript v2.0 complete (~6,000 words, 617 lines)  
**Supplementary Materials:** S1-S3 complete (~3,000 words), S4-S8 pending  
**Date:** October 13, 2025

---

## FORMAT RECOMMENDATION: Full Research Article (~8,000 words)

### Why Full Article?

✅ **Compelling narrative arc:** Success → Challenge → Correction → Validation  
✅ **Novel methodology:** Context Gates framework deserves full treatment  
✅ **Multiple validation domains:** CBD + NF2 + Dark Energy  
✅ **Self-correction story:** Rare in AI literature, worth depth  
✅ **Target journals:** Nature Methods, Science Advances prefer comprehensive articles  

### Alternative (Not Recommended): Methods Paper (~4,000 words)

❌ **Too brief** for the self-correction narrative  
❌ **Insufficient space** for Context Gates + validation + cross-domain  
❌ **Loses impact** of the challenge-response-improvement story
