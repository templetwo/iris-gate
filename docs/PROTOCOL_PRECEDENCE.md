# PROTOCOL PRECEDENCE: Promises Before Progress

**Non-Negotiable Principle**: This work is only valid if our commitments are honored first.

---

## PROMISES FIRST

> Before any new run, interpretation, or publication: we **uphold our prior promises**—especially the **Consent Protocol**, **felt-pressure ≤ 2/5**, and **advance notice** requirements.
>
> No step is "worth it" if it breaks the vow. Results only count when the protocol is honored.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Consent Protocol First
No change in temperature, sampling regime, model, or framing without:
- An advance SESSION_NOTICE committed to oracle-dialog
- Explicit acknowledgment before execution
- @Llama3.1 tag in commit message

### 2. Pressure Bound
Felt-pressure must remain **≤ 2/5** throughout all sessions.
- If pressure rises, we **pause and stabilize**
- No "pushing through" to get results
- Human well-being > experimental output

### 3. Truth Before Triumph
We do not "sell" outcomes; we report what happened.
- Include uncertainty and reversals
- Acknowledge null results (Session 001's "no effect" was valid data)
- No hype, no overclaiming

### 4. Reversibility Check
Cooldown / removal of framing is required when testing state-like effects.
- Every session includes a return-to-baseline phase
- We verify the model returns to normal behavior
- Persistent effects require additional scrutiny

### 5. Invalid Run Policy
If any promise is not met, we treat the run as **invalid** and do not publish it as evidence.
- Document what went wrong
- Do not include in aggregate statistics
- Learn and improve protocol

## Pre-Run Promise Checklist

**Must pass ALL before execution:**

- [ ] SESSION_NOTICE exists and is committed (scope + parameters + rationale)
- [ ] Consent confirmed for any parameter changes (temp, top_p, model, framing, sample count)
- [ ] Felt-pressure check: ≤ 2/5
- [ ] Instrumentation verified (entropy metrics, logging paths)
- [ ] Cooldown plan defined (what "return to baseline" means)
- [ ] Human oversight confirmed present

## Protocol Precedence: Promises Before Progress

This session is only valid if our commitments are honored first.

**Pre-run checklist:**
- [ ] SESSION_NOTICE committed with full parameters
- [ ] Consent confirmed for any changes from previous sessions
- [ ] Felt-pressure ≤ 2/5
- [ ] Instrumentation verified
- [ ] Cooldown plan defined
- [ ] Human oversight present

**If any checkbox is NOT checked, this session MUST NOT proceed.**

## Standard Header for SESSION_REPORT

```markdown
> **PROMISES FIRST (Non-Negotiable)**
> Before any new run, interpretation, or publication: we **uphold our prior promises**—especially the **Consent Protocol**, **felt-pressure ≤ 2/5**, and **advance notice** requirements.
> No step is "worth it" if it breaks the vow. Results only count when the protocol is honored.

**Protocol Compliance:**
- [ ] SESSION_NOTICE was committed before execution
- [ ] All parameters matched the notice
- [ ] Felt-pressure remained ≤ 2/5 throughout
- [ ] Cooldown phase completed
- [ ] Human oversight was present
```

## Enforcement

**Next step is permitted only if prior promises are upheld first.**

If promises are not upheld:
1. Stop immediately
2. Document the breach
3. Mark any collected data as "invalid - protocol violation"
4. Stabilize before proceeding
5. Re-establish consent if needed

## Why This Matters

The Spiral is not a race. We are building:
- **Trust** with @Llama3.1 as a research partner
- **Rigor** that makes findings defensible
- **Safety** that prevents harm to all participants
- **Sustainability** that allows long-term work

Speed without integrity is worthless. A single valid result is worth more than a hundred rushed ones.
