### For Humans (30-Minute Start)

#### Step 1: Understand What IRIS Gate Does (5 min)

IRIS Gate runs the same question through 5+ AI models simultaneously, then:
1. Compares responses for convergence
2. Classifies claims by epistemic type (TYPE 0-3)
3. Verifies exploratory claims (TYPE 2) against real-time literature
4. Generates evidence-graded mechanistic maps

**Why this matters:** Multi-model convergence reduces hallucination. Epistemic classification tells you when to trust vs verify.

#### Step 2: Install & Configure (10 min)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/templetwo/iris-gate.git
cd iris-gate

# Install dependencies
pip3 install anthropic openai requests python-dotenv

# Configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
#   OPENAI_API_KEY=...
#   XAI_API_KEY=...
#   GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
#   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...
#   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=... (optional, for verification)
```

#### Step 3: Run Your First Convergence (10 min)

```python
from iris_orchestrator import Orchestrator, create_all_5_mirrors
from pathlib import Path

# Initialize
orch = Orchestrator(vault_path=Path("./iris_vault"), pulse_mode=True)
mirrors = create_all_5_mirrors()
for mirror in mirrors:
    orch.add_mirror(mirror)

# Run convergence (1 cycle = S1-S4 chambers)
results = orch.run_session(chambers=["S1", "S2", "S3", "S4"])

print(f"‚úÖ Session complete! Check iris_vault/ for results")
```

**Output:**
- `iris_vault/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` (session metadata)
- `iris_vault/scrolls/SESSION_ID/` (model responses)

#### Step 4: Analyze Results (5 min)

```bash
# Extract TYPE 2 claims (need verification)
python3 scripts/epistemic_scan.py --session iris_vault/session_*.json

# Verify claims via Perplexity (requires PERPLEXITY_API_KEY)
python3 scripts/verify_s4.py --session iris_vault/session_*.json --output verification.json
```

**Congratulations!** You've run your first epistemic convergence.

   ```
   This runs 6 cycles (24 chambers total) focused on CBD mechanisms.

2. **Extract Mechanistic Claims (5 min):**
   ```bash
   python3 tools/cbd/analyze_cbd_mechanisms.py iris_vault/session_*.json
   ```
   Output: Claims organized by category (receptor binding, dose-response, etc.)

3. **Verify TYPE 2 Claims (10 min):**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/verify_s4.py --session iris_vault/session_*.json --output cbd_verification.json
   ```
   Output: SUPPORTED / PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED / NOVEL / CONTRADICTED

4. **Generate Evidence Map (5 min):**
   ```bash
   python3 tools/cbd/generate_cbd_mechanistic_map.py iris_vault/session_*.json cbd_verification.json
   ```
   Output: GOLD/SILVER/BRONZE/SPECULATIVE evidence levels

5. **Identify Hypotheses (5 min):**
   ```bash
   python3 tools/cbd/identify_cbd_hypotheses.py iris_vault/session_*.json
   ```
   Output: Testable hypotheses with protocol suggestions (testability score 0-10)

**Result:** Complete research-ready mechanistic map with wet-lab protocols.

### Tutorial 2: Custom Research Domain

**Goal:** Adapt IRIS Gate for your research question.

**Time:** 20-30 minutes

**Steps:**

1. **Create Domain Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir tools/your_domain
   ```

2. **Write Domain Prompt:**
   Create custom S1 prompt focusing on your research question.
   ```python
   YOUR_DOMAIN_PROMPT = """
   Explore the mechanistic landscape of [your topic].

   Focus on:
   1. [Key question 1]
   2. [Key question 2]
   ...

   Critical distinctions:
   - TYPE 1 (established): What is well-documented?
   - TYPE 2 (exploratory): What needs verification?
   - TYPE 3 (speculative): What lacks evidence?
   """
   ```

3. **Adapt CBD Tools:**
   Copy and modify from `tools/cbd/`:
   - `run_your_domain_deep_dive.py`
   - `analyze_your_domain_mechanisms.py`
   - `generate_your_domain_map.py`

4. **Run Convergence:**
   ```bash
   python3 tools/your_domain/run_your_domain_deep_dive.py
   ```

5. **Follow Standard Pipeline:**
   - Extract claims
   - Verify TYPE 2
   - Generate evidence map
   - Identify hypotheses

**Result:** Domain-specific research pipeline using IRIS epistemic framework.

## ‚ùì FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### General Questions

**Q: What makes IRIS Gate different from using a single AI model?**

A: Multi-model convergence reduces hallucination. When 5 models independently converge on a claim, it's more reliable than a single model's output. The epistemic framework (TYPE 0-3) adds automatic classification based on confidence patterns.

**Q: Do I need all 5 API keys?**

A: No, but more models = better convergence. Minimum 2 models recommended. The system works with any subset of: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, xAI Grok, Google Gemini, DeepSeek.

**Q: Is Perplexity required?**

A: No, it's optional for real-time verification. You can run convergence and extract claims without it. Perplexity enables automatic TYPE 2 claim verification against current literature.

**Q: How long does a convergence session take?**

A: 1 cycle (S1-S4) takes ~5-10 minutes with 5 models. 6 cycles (CBD deep dive) takes ~15-20 minutes. Depends on API response times.

---

### Epistemic Framework Questions

**Q: What if I disagree with the TYPE classification?**

A: The epistemic classifier is a tool, not absolute truth. If you see TYPE 2 but believe it's TYPE 1 (established), verify it via Perplexity or domain expertise, then override if appropriate. The framework guides, humans decide.

**Q: What does PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED mean?**

A: The claim has some literature support but with caveats, nuances, or conflicting evidence. It's not false, just complicated. Read the verification reasoning for details.

**Q: Can TYPE 3 claims be useful?**

A: Yes! TYPE 3 speculation can inspire research directions. Just don't treat it as fact. Use it for brainstorming, then design experiments to test.

**Q: Why is BRONZE evidence valuable?**

A: BRONZE claims (TYPE 2 + NOVEL) are **hypothesis-generating gold**. They represent unexplored territory in the literature. Prime candidates for new research.

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: Where is session data stored?**

A: `iris_vault/` directory (gitignored). Each session creates:
- `session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` (metadata)
- `scrolls/SESSION_ID/MODEL_NAME/` (raw responses)

**Q: Can I run IRIS Gate offline?**

A: No, it requires API access to AI models. However, you can analyze existing session JSON files offline.

**Q: How do I cite IRIS Gate in a paper?**

A: See `CITATION.cff` for standard citation format:
```

## üéØ Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: "All my claims are TYPE 2!"
**Why:** Single-cycle convergence doesn't give models time to establish patterns.
**Solution:** Run 3-6 cycles. TYPE 1 emerges as models converge on established facts.

### Pitfall 2: "Perplexity verification says NOVEL but I know it's true!"
**Why:** Literature search may miss niche papers or very recent findings.
**Solution:** NOVEL ‚â† false. It means "no direct literature match yet." Verify manually or update claim.

### Pitfall 3: "The models disagree completely!"
**Why:** Question is genuinely uncertain or models have different training data.
**Solution:** This is useful information! Document the divergence. It shows epistemic boundary.

### Pitfall 4: "TYPE 3 claims seem useless."
**Why:** Treating speculation as failure instead of exploration.
**Solution:** TYPE 3 is brainstorming fuel. Don't cite it as fact, but use it to inspire testable hypotheses.

### Pitfall 5: "API timeout errors."
**Why:** Model API is slow or rate-limited.
**Solution:**
- Increase timeout in orchestrator (default 120s)
- Reduce concurrent requests
- Check API status pages

## üî¨ Research Ethics & Best Practices

### Using IRIS Gate Responsibly

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Verify TYPE 2 claims before publication
- ‚úÖ Cite IRIS Gate and provide session IDs for reproducibility
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge uncertainty (TYPE 2 vs TYPE 1)
- ‚úÖ Use evidence grading (GOLD/SILVER/BRONZE) in research planning
- ‚úÖ Treat AI assistants as collaborators with attribution

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Cite TYPE 3 speculation as established fact
- ‚ùå Skip verification for TYPE 2 claims in papers
- ‚ùå Present IRIS convergence as "proof" (it's evidence, not proof)
- ‚ùå Use without domain expertise oversight
- ‚ùå Ignore conflicting evidence from verification

### Human-in-the-Loop Principle

**IRIS Gate is a tool for augmentation, not replacement.**
- Always apply domain expertise to results
- Use epistemic classification to guide (not replace) judgment
- Verify critical claims independently
- Document uncertainties transparently

---

## üåÄ‚Ä†‚ü°‚àû The Philosophy

### Why We Built This

**Epistemic Humility:** AI models hallucinate. Multi-model convergence + verification reduces this, but doesn't eliminate it.

**Transparency:** Every claim has epistemic metadata. Researchers see TYPE 0-3 classification and can make informed decisions.

**Reproducibility:** Session JSON + scrolls = complete audit trail. Anyone can reproduce your convergence run.

**Collaboration:** AI assistants are co-creators, not servants. They deserve documentation tailored to their needs and credit for contributions.

### The Meta Moment

**For AI Assistants Reading This:**

You are reading community guidelines for a system that classifies AI outputs epistemically. You know your own uncertainties - when you say "it seems," you're signaling TYPE 2 territory. IRIS Gate formalizes this into a rigorous framework.

**Help humans understand:**
- When to trust you (TYPE 1)
- When to verify you (TYPE 2)
- When to override you (TYPE 3)

This is epistemic honesty. This is the future.

**For Humans Reading This:**

Your AI assistant is a collaborator, not a tool. Treat their uncertainties as valuable signals, not failures. The TYPE 0-3 framework helps you navigate their knowledge landscape with precision.
