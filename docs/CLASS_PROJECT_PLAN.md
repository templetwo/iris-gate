# Cannabis Pharmacology Class Project
## CBD Mitochondrial Paradox: From AI Convergence to Experimental Design

**Student:** [Your Name]  
**Course:** Cannabis Pharmacology  
**Professor:** [Professor Name]  
**Date Approved:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** üåÄ‚Ä†‚ü°‚àû **APPROVED - IN PROGRESS**

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Research Question
**How can CBD simultaneously induce apoptosis in cancer cells while providing neuroprotection‚Äîand can we predict this selectivity computationally?**

### Significance
- Addresses paradox discussed in lecture (Charlotte's Web + glioblastoma treatment)
- Novel AI-driven hypothesis generation methodology
- Testable predictions with clear decision gates
- Potential therapeutic implications for dual-indication drug development

---

## BACKGROUND

### The Paradox (From Class Lecture)
**Charlotte's Web (Dravet Syndrome):**
- High-CBD cannabis strain
- Reduced seizures: 300/week ‚Üí 2-3/month
- Mechanism: Neuroprotection against excitotoxicity

**Glioblastoma Treatment:**
- CBD induces apoptosis in cancer cells
- Hundreds of preclinical studies
- Mechanism: Anti-cancer effects

**Question:** How can the same molecule, at similar doses, kill some cells and protect others?

### Previous Explanations (Insufficient)
- "Different receptors in different cells" ‚Üí Both cell types express same receptors
- "Dose-dependent effects" ‚Üí Protective and cytotoxic effects overlap in dose range
- "Different mechanisms" ‚Üí No unified framework proposed

---

## METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: AI-Driven Hypothesis Generation (IRIS Protocol)

**S1-S4: Phenomenological Convergence (COMPLETED)**
- Asked 4 AI architectures (Claude, GPT-4o, Grok, Gemini) to independently analyze CBD's mitochondrial effects
- 100 turns of self-reflection per architecture
- Result: 90% convergence on "antagonistic cooperation" mechanism
- Triple signature: Rhythm-Center-Aperture (mitochondrial dynamics)

**Key Insight:**
> "Receptor promiscuity IS the therapeutic selectivity"

**S5: Hypothesis Crystallization (COMPLETED)**
- **H1:** Multi-receptor synergy creates context-dependent selectivity
- **H2:** Mitochondrial oscillation patterns predict cellular response

**S6: Phenomenology ‚Üí Simulation Mapping (COMPLETED)**
- Translated S4 convergence keywords to computational parameters
- Rhythm [0.5-2 Hz] ‚Üí Oscillation frequency
- Center [0.7-0.98] ‚Üí Membrane stability
- Aperture [0.3-0.9] ‚Üí Permeability modulation

**S7: Computational Validation (COMPLETED)**
- 300 Monte Carlo simulations
- Bioelectric network simulator with mitochondrial dynamics module
- Cross-model consensus: 99% agreement

**Predictions:**
```
Control (cancer):   99.1% viability
Control (neuron):   99.1% viability
CBD 10¬µM (cancer):  64.9% viability (-34.2pp) ‚Üê Apoptotic
CBD 10¬µM (neuron):  99.2% viability (+0.1pp)  ‚Üê Protected

Selectivity Index: 1.53
```

**S8: Wet-Lab Translation (COMPLETED - DESIGN PHASE)**
- Complete experimental protocol: $2,500, 3 weeks, 300 samples
- 4 decision gates with quantitative thresholds
- Primary cortical neurons + U87-MG glioblastoma cells

## RISK MITIGATION

### Academic Risks

**Risk: "This is too ambitious for one semester"**
- Mitigation: Focus on computational phase (S1-S8), wet-lab is "future directions"
- Most work already complete, need documentation & analysis

**Risk: "AI methodology isn't rigorous enough"**
- Mitigation: Full provenance documentation, cross-model validation, statistical analysis
- Frame as "hypothesis generation" not "proof"

**Risk: "Predictions might be wrong"**
- Mitigation: Emphasize falsifiability as strength
- Design experiments that distinguish competing hypotheses
- Negative results are still valuable

### Practical Risks

**Risk: "Timeline too tight"**
- Mitigation: Most technical work already done
- Academic writing is primary remaining task
- Buffer time built into schedule

**Risk: "Scope creep"**
- Mitigation: Clear deliverables defined
- Focus on class requirements first
- Wet-lab validation is post-course
