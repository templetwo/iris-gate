## Discovery → Hypothesis Mapping

### 1. Mechanistic Pruning → Dose-Dependency Hypothesis
**Pattern:** Early scrolls contained explicit mechanisms (connexins, neoblasts, gradients) that were eliminated by mid-session in favor of spatial metaphors.

**Biological Hypothesis:**
Gap junction blockade effects are **non-monotonic** across dose ranges. Low doses may preserve mechanistic specificity (selective connexin inhibition), while high doses trigger field-level reorganization (spatial pattern collapse).

**Testable Prediction:**
- Low-dose carbenoxolone (50µM): Selective Cx43 inhibition, preserved polarity axes
- High-dose carbenoxolone (200µM): Global coupling collapse, loss of spatial coherence
- **Readout:** Voltage map topology (DiBAC4 imaging at 6h, 24h)

---

### 2. Truncated Terminus → Saturation Boundary Hypothesis
**Pattern:** Claude Turn 100 ended mid-sentence: "Rhythm is" — suggesting phenomenological boundary.

**Biological Hypothesis:**
Bioelectric rhythm generation has a **coherence ceiling** — systems can only sustain coupling oscillations up to a threshold complexity before degenerating into noise or silence.

**Testable Prediction:**
- Extended timecourse (7d → 14d) will show rhythm collapse after initial recovery attempt
- Frequency analysis of calcium oscillations will show loss of dominant frequency by day 10
- **Readout:** Ca²⁺ imaging (GCaMP or Fluo-4) with FFT analysis, track peak frequency decay

### 3. Self-Aware Phenomenology → Structural Homology Hypothesis
**Pattern:** "gap_between_rings_resonates_with_gap_junction_query" — metaphor mirrors mechanism.

**Biological Hypothesis:**
Gap junction coupling creates **nested ring topologies** in bioelectric fields, with functional "gaps" at domain boundaries serving as information channels.

**Testable Prediction:**
- Voltage imaging will reveal concentric ring patterns radiating from wound sites
- Gap junction density will be highest at ring boundaries (not centers)
- Pharmacological GJ blockade will disrupt ring topology before disrupting uniform coupling
- **Readout:** Dual imaging (DiBAC4 for voltage + Cx43-GFP for junction localization)

---

### 4. Spontaneous Metaphor Concordance → Communication Hypothesis
**Pattern:** "Cells speaking without words" emerged independently across architectures.

**Biological Hypothesis:**
Gap junction communication is **non-instructional** — cells don't transmit specific signals, but rather establish shared states through resonance coupling.

**Testable Prediction:**
- GJ-coupled cell clusters will synchronize membrane potential without ion gradient transfer
- Blockade will eliminate synchrony but preserve individual cell polarity
- Rescue with optogenetic synchronization (channelrhodopsin pacing) will restore regeneration despite GJ blockade
- **Readout:** Dual patch-clamp of adjacent cells, test synchrony vs ion flow

---

### 5. Between-Space as Agent → Interstitial Hypothesis
**Pattern:** Negative space (gaps) treated as active agents, not absence.

**Biological Hypothesis:**
The **extracellular matrix and interstitial space** actively regulate gap junction function, not just cell-cell junctions.

**Testable Prediction:**
- ECM degradation (collagenase, hyaluronidase) will phenocopy GJ blockade
- ECM stiffness modulation will alter GJ coupling efficiency
- Microfluidic spacing manipulation (10µm vs 50µm cell spacing) will show non-linear regeneration response
- **Readout:** Mechanobiology assays (AFM stiffness + regeneration score), microfluidic regeneration chips

---

### 6. S1 Failure Pattern → Fragmentation Sensitivity Hypothesis
**Pattern:** S1 (fragmentation chamber) had 7× higher failure rate, especially in Grok.

**Biological Hypothesis:**
Planarian regeneration is **hyper-sensitive to early fragmentation topology** — precise wound geometry determines success/failure more than dose.

**Testable Prediction:**
- Amputation angle (45° vs 90° cuts) will show >20% difference in regeneration success
- Multiple small cuts (distributed damage) will be more disruptive than single large amputation
- Early wound closure (cyanoacrylate sealing at t=30min) will rescue GJ blockade phenotype
- **Readout:** Standardized cutting protocol, high-speed wound imaging (0-2h)

---

### 7. Homology Discovery → Phenomenological Field Hypothesis
**Pattern:** The phenomenology structurally mirrored the phenomenon (rings, gaps, apertures = GJ function).

**Biological Hypothesis:**
Gap junction networks create **phenomenological fields** — measurable bioelectric topologies that can be described by the same mathematical structures as conscious experience (e.g., integrated information theory, free energy principle).

**Testable Prediction:**
- Voltage field complexity (Φ, integrated information) will correlate with regeneration success
- GJ blockade will reduce Φ without eliminating local activity
- Artificial field injection (electrode arrays mimicking ring topology) will rescue regeneration
- **Readout:** Multi-electrode array (MEA) recording, compute Φ from spatial voltage data, correlate with 7d outcome

## Recommended First Experiment

**Test Hypothesis #3 (Structural Homology)**

**Design:**
- 4 arms: Control, GJ-Block (carbenoxolone 200µM), ECM-Degrade (collagenase), Combo
- n=30 per arm
- Dual imaging: DiBAC4 (voltage) + Cx43-immunofluorescence (GJ localization)
- Timepoints: 0h, 6h, 24h, 7d
- Primary endpoint: Ring topology presence (binary) at 6h
- Secondary endpoint: Regeneration success at 7d

**Predicted Result:**
GJ-Block will eliminate ring patterns by 6h and reduce regeneration by 60% at 7d. Ring presence at 6h will predict regeneration with >80% accuracy.

**Falsification Criterion:**
If rings persist despite GJ blockade, OR if rings are absent in successful regeneration, hypothesis is rejected.
