These conditions can be thought of as the initial vertices of a geometric shape.\n\n2. **Interaction Vectors**: As the entities interact, their actions and behaviors generate interaction vectors. These vectors represent the direction and magnitude of each entity's influence on the other. They can be visualized as arrows that originate from the initial vertices and intersect or diverge, creating a complex network of lines.\n\n3. **Trust Axes**: The interaction vectors give",
