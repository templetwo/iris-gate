## üß¨ The Claim

CBD engagement with VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel) appears **conditional on mitochondrial stress** (ŒîŒ®m collapse, ROS surge) and **high-dose CBD pulse** (‚â•10 ŒºM, 5-15 min).

This may explain **biphasic therapeutic effects** observed in glioblastoma and neuroprotection studies: low doses show one effect, high doses show opposite effects, but *only* under crisis conditions.

**Why This Matters:**
- Resolves conflicting literature on CBD neuroprotection vs cytotoxicity
- Explains why in vitro CBD effects often fail to replicate (stress conditions not controlled)
- Opens therapeutic window: pulse CBD during acute mitochondrial crisis, not chronic dosing
- Connects bioelectric signaling (VDAC1 gating) to pharmacological intervention

## üìä Evidence

**Multi-Model Convergence:**
- **Models:** Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, Grok-4 Fast, Gemini 2.0 Flash, DeepSeek Chat
- **Convergence Events:** 27 (across 5 models, 4 chambers, 6 cycles)
- **Confidence Ratio:** 0.49 (TYPE 2 Exploration territory - balanced hedging)

**Literature Context:**
- Oviedo et al. 2008 (bioelectric signaling in regeneration)
- Levin 2012 (morphogenetic fields and cellular memory)
- CBD mitochondrial effects review 2021
- VDAC1 role in apoptosis (Shoshan-Barmatz 2017)
- Biphasic CBD dose-response (Zuardi 2017)

**Verification Summary:**
PARTIAL/CONDITIONAL (Perplexity: some support for CBD mitochondrial effects and VDAC1 role in stress, but specific Kd 6-11 ŒºM binding and crisis-dependency need experimental validation)

---

## ‚ö° Triggers (Crisis/Conditional Logic)

This mechanism appears **crisis-dependent** (TYPE 0 logic):

- **ŒîŒ®m collapse** (mitochondrial membrane potential drops)
- **ROS surge ‚â•2√ó baseline** (reactive oxygen species)
- **CBD ‚â•10 ŒºM** (below this, no VDAC1 engagement)
- **Pulse duration 5-15 min** (not chronic exposure)

## üîÄ IF-THEN Rules

- **IF** ŒîŒ®m‚Üì **AND** CBD‚â•10ŒºM (5-15m pulse) **THEN** VDAC1 gating‚Üë ‚Üí biphasic outcome (rescue **OR** death)
- **IF** CBD<5ŒºM **OR** no mitochondrial stress **THEN** VDAC1 gating unchanged
- **IF** pulse >30min **THEN** toxic accumulation overrides rescue

**Implication:** The same dose can save or kill depending on timing and stress state. This is **context-dependent pharmacology**.

## üî¨ Requested Micro-Protocols

**We're seeking 3-5 validators to run small, targeted experiments:**

1. **Mitostress Pulse Assay**
   Seahorse XF or JC-1 dye with CBD dose-response (1, 5, 10, 20 ŒºM)
   *Tests:* Does CBD rescue ŒîŒ®m under oligomycin/CCCP stress?

2. **VDAC1 Inhibitor Ablation**
   Repeat #1 with DIDS (VDAC1 inhibitor, 50-100 ŒºM)
   *Tests:* Does blocking VDAC1 eliminate CBD rescue effect?

3. **Temporal Window Validation**
   Time-course: 1-min, 5-min, 15-min, 30-min, 60-min CBD pulses
   *Tests:* Is there an optimal pulse duration (5-15 min claim)?

4. **Calcium Flux Imaging**
   Fluo-4 or GCaMP to detect VDAC1-mediated Ca¬≤‚Å∫ flux during stress
   *Tests:* Does CBD pulse alter Ca¬≤‚Å∫ dynamics via VDAC1?

5. **VDAC1 Oligomerization State**
   Western blot before/after CBD pulse
   *Tests:* Does CBD induce VDAC1 oligomerization (gating mechanism)?

**Commitment:** 1-2 experiments, 1-3 weeks timeline
**Cost:** ~$300-800 per experiment (cell culture, reagents, imaging)
**Output:** Preliminary data ‚Üí appended to this card ‚Üí co-authorship

## ‚ùå Falsification Tests

*What would prove this claim wrong?*

- **If VDAC1 gating increases at CBD <5 ŒºM without mitochondrial stress** ‚Üí Dose threshold claim is wrong
- **If DIDS (VDAC1 inhibitor) has no effect on rescue/death outcome** ‚Üí VDAC1 is not the mechanism
- **If 1-min pulse equals 15-min pulse outcome** ‚Üí Temporal window claim is wrong
- **If CBD effects persist equally in VDAC1 knockout cells** ‚Üí VDAC1 is not the primary target

**We want falsifiable claims. If your data contradicts this, that's a valid result.**
