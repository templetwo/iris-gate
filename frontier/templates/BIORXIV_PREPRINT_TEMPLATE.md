## Abstract

**Background:** [1-2 sentences on the research domain and why this question matters]

**Methods:** We used the IRIS Frontier Bridge system to generate testable hypotheses via multi-model AI convergence (N=[X] models, confidence ratio=[Y], TYPE 2 exploration). The resulting hypothesis was preregistered on OSF, packaged as a Mystery Card ([Card ID]), and validated independently by [N] laboratories.

**Results:** [3-4 sentences summarizing key findings across all validation experiments. Include quantitative results with p-values.]

**Conclusions:** [2 sentences on interpretation and implications]

**Data Availability:** All raw data, analysis code, and protocols are publicly available at [URLs].

**Preregistration:** OSF [URL], AsPredicted [URL]

## Introduction

### Background

[2-3 paragraphs on the research domain, existing literature, and knowledge gaps]

### The IRIS Frontier Bridge Approach

The IRIS Gate system generates hypotheses via multi-model epistemic convergence, where identical prompts are processed by diverse AI architectures (Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini, DeepSeek) and responses are classified by epistemic type (TYPE 0-3)¹. TYPE 2 claims (Exploration/Novel, confidence ratio 0.40-0.60) represent hypothesis-generating territory: balanced between established knowledge and speculation.

**This study originated from:**
- **IRIS Session:** [Session ID]
- **Convergence Events:** [N] (across [M] models)
- **Confidence Ratio:** [X] (TYPE 2 territory)
- **Verification Status:** BRONZE (novel, needs validation)

The claim was packaged as Mystery Card [Card ID] and routed to opt-in validators via the Frontier Network.

### Hypothesis

[State the primary hypothesis from the Mystery Card, including all IF-THEN rules and triggers]

**Example:**
We hypothesized that CBD engagement with VDAC1 is **crisis-dependent**, requiring:
1. Mitochondrial stress (ΔΨm collapse)
2. High-dose CBD pulse (≥10 μM)
3. Temporal window (5-15 min)

**IF-THEN Rules:**
- IF ΔΨm↓ AND CBD≥10μM (5-15m pulse) THEN VDAC1 gating↑
- IF CBD<5μM OR no stress THEN VDAC1 gating unchanged

### Preregistration

All predictions were preregistered on OSF ([URL]) and AsPredicted ([URL]) **before** any validation experiments began. This locks falsification criteria and prevents post-hoc rationalization.

## Discussion

### Principal Findings

[2-3 paragraphs summarizing key results]

### Comparison to Existing Literature

[How do these results fit with/contradict prior work?]

### Strengths

1. **Preregistration:** Locked predictions before testing
2. **Multi-lab replication:** Independent validation (N=[X] labs)
3. **Open data:** Full transparency (raw data + code)
4. **Adversarial testing:** [If applicable - skeptics tested edge cases]
5. **Multi-model convergence:** Hypothesis emerged from diverse architectures

### Limitations

1. [Limitation 1 - be honest]
2. [Limitation 2]
3. [Boundary conditions not tested]
4. [Alternative explanations not ruled out]

### Future Directions

[2-3 specific follow-up experiments or testable predictions]

### Implications for AI-Human Collaboration

This study demonstrates a new paradigm for AI-assisted hypothesis generation:

1. **Multi-model convergence** identifies TYPE 2 territory (exploratory but testable)
2. **Mystery Cards** package claims with falsification criteria
3. **Frontier Network** routes hypotheses to validators
4. **Preregistration + open data** ensure rigor
5. **Multi-lab replication** confirms robustness

**Key insight:** Novelty is a routing problem, not a credibility problem. BRONZE claims aren't "weak" - they need the right hands to test them.
