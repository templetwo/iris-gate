# OSF Preregistration Template for IRIS Mystery Cards

**IRIS Frontier Bridge (S9: Connection) â€” Novelty is a routing problem, not a credibility problem.**

---

## Purpose

This template ensures Mystery Cards are **preregistered BEFORE any validation experiments run**.

Preregistration:
- Locks predictions and falsification criteria
- Prevents p-hacking and goalpost-moving
- Provides timestamped audit trail
- Proves we stated claims BEFORE data arrived

---

## How to Use

1. Copy this template
2. Fill in all fields for your Mystery Card
3. Upload to OSF (https://osf.io) BEFORE running any experiments
4. Make registration **public**
5. Add OSF URL to Mystery Card JSON
6. Link registration in GitHub Issue

### Research Question

**Primary Hypothesis:**
[State the core claim from the Mystery Card]

Example: CBD engagement with VDAC1 is conditional on mitochondrial stress (Î”Î¨m collapse) and requires high-dose CBD pulse (â‰¥10 Î¼M, 5-15 min).

**IF-THEN Rules:**
[List all conditional statements from the card]

Example:
1. IF Î”Î¨mâ†“ AND CBDâ‰¥10Î¼M (5-15m pulse) THEN VDAC1 gatingâ†‘ (biphasic outcome)
2. IF CBD<5Î¼M OR no stress THEN VDAC1 gating unchanged
3. IF pulse >30min THEN toxic accumulation overrides rescue

**Triggers (Crisis Conditions):**
[List all crisis/conditional triggers]

Example:
- Î”Î¨m collapse (JC-1 ratio <0.5)
- ROS surge â‰¥2Ã— baseline (DCF-DA assay)
- CBD concentration â‰¥10 Î¼M
- Pulse duration 5-15 min

### Preregistered Predictions

**Each prediction must include:**
- Quantitative threshold
- Statistical criterion (p-value, effect size)
- Direction of effect

**Prediction 1: [Micro-protocol name]**
- **Test:** [Brief description]
- **Prediction:** IF [condition] THEN [outcome with numbers]
- **Threshold:** [Numerical criterion for "supported"]
- **Statistical Test:** [t-test, ANOVA, etc.]
- **Alpha:** p < 0.05 (or specify other)

Example:
- **Test:** Mitostress pulse assay with CBD dose-response
- **Prediction:** IF CBD â‰¥10Î¼M + oligomycin-induced Î”Î¨m collapse THEN JC-1 ratio increases â‰¥50% vs stress-only control
- **Threshold:** Î”JC-1 â‰¥ 0.25 (absolute increase)
- **Statistical Test:** One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-hoc
- **Alpha:** p < 0.05

**Prediction 2: [Next micro-protocol]**
[Repeat structure]

**Prediction 3-N:**
[Continue for all requested tests from Mystery Card]

---

### Falsification Criteria (CRITICAL)

**This claim will be considered FALSIFIED if:**

1. [Specific outcome that proves claim wrong]
2. [Another outcome]
3. [etc.]

Example:
1. If VDAC1 gating increases at CBD <5 Î¼M without mitochondrial stress (p<0.05) â†’ Dose threshold claim is wrong
2. If DIDS (VDAC1 inhibitor, 100 Î¼M) has no effect on rescue/death outcome (no significant difference vs CBD-only) â†’ Mechanism claim is wrong
3. If 1-min pulse equals 15-min pulse outcome (no significant difference) â†’ Temporal window claim is wrong
4. If CBD effects persist equally in VDAC1 knockout cells vs wildtype â†’ VDAC1 not the primary target

**Null Result Interpretation:**
If all micro-protocols show null results (no significant effects), this will be interpreted as: [describe what null means]

Example: Crisis-dependency confirmed but specific VDAC1 mechanism not supported; alternative mitochondrial targets implicated.

### Methods

**Model System:**
[Cells, organism, or computational]

Example: HEK293 cells, U87 glioblastoma cells

**Key Reagents:**
- [Compound 1]: [Concentration range], [Vendor], [Catalog #]
- [Compound 2]: ...

Example:
- CBD (cannabidiol): 1-20 Î¼M, Sigma-Aldrich, C1112
- DIDS (VDAC1 inhibitor): 50-100 Î¼M, Tocris, 0882
- Oligomycin (mitostress inducer): 1 Î¼M, Sigma, O4876

**Readouts:**
- [Primary readout]: [Method], [Equipment]
- [Secondary readout]: ...

Example:
- JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential: Fluorescence ratio (590nm/530nm), plate reader
- ROS (DCF-DA): Fluorescence (485/535nm)
- Calcium flux (Fluo-4): Live imaging, confocal microscope

**Sample Size:**
- **Biological replicates:** n = [number] per condition
- **Technical replicates:** n = [number] per sample
- **Power analysis:** [If available, describe expected effect size and power]

Example:

### Analysis Plan

**Statistical Methods:**
[Describe exact statistical tests for each prediction]

Example:
- One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-hoc (vs control) for dose-response
- Two-way ANOVA (stress Ã— CBD) with Tukey's post-hoc for interaction effects
- Student's t-test for pairwise comparisons (e.g., +DIDS vs -DIDS)

**Outlier Handling:**
[Describe criteria for excluding data points, if any]

Example: No outlier exclusion unless technical failure documented (e.g., plate reader error). All data included in supplementary files.

**Multiple Comparisons Correction:**
[Bonferroni, FDR, or other]

Example: Bonferroni correction for family-wise error rate (Î±_adjusted = 0.05 / k comparisons)

**Stopping Rules:**
[When will you stop collecting data?]

Example: Fixed sample size (n=4 biological replicates). No optional stopping based on interim results.

### Conflicts of Interest

**Do any authors have financial or intellectual conflicts?**
[Yes/No and describe]

Example: No conflicts of interest. This is an open science collaboration with no commercial funding.

### Additional Notes

[Any other relevant information]

Example:
- This experiment tests a TYPE 2 (Exploration/Novel) claim from IRIS Gate multi-model convergence
- Card was generated from Session 20251015_211606 (5 models, 27 convergence events, confidence ratio 0.49)
- Perplexity verification: PARTIAL/CONDITIONAL (needs experimental validation)
- Null results will be published and credited equally to positive results

## After Registration

**Once uploaded to OSF:**

1. Copy the OSF registration URL
2. Update Mystery Card JSON with preregistration fields
3. Post registration URL in GitHub Issue
4. Announce to validators: "Predictions locked, ready to test"
