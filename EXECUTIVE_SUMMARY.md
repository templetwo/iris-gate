**Cross-Architecture AI Convergence on Mass-Coherence Correspondence**

## What We Did

We conducted the first systematic convergence study testing whether diverse AI architectures independently arrive at consistent theoretical frameworks when reasoning about fundamental physics. Five flagship models (Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.2, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3.0 Pro, DeepSeek V3) were queried 13 times across 6 probes about the Mass-Coherence Correspondence Hypothesis—whether physical mass, semantic robustness, and conscious coherence share fundamental informational structure.

## What We Found

**Universal Convergence**: All five models independently converged on Verlinde's entropic gravity framework (1,894 citations) and Integrated Information Theory (943 citations) across 390 total responses spanning 19 MB of physics discourse.

**Stability**: Response content stabilized from 7,375 to 7,061 characters (4.2% compression) across iterations, suggesting asymptotic convergence rather than random exploration.

**Novel Predictions**: Gemini 3.0 Pro proposed three testable hypotheses:

1. **Semantic Schwarzschild Radius**: Neural networks possess informational event horizons beyond which perturbations cannot propagate
2. **Fisher Information Mass Formula**: M_semantic = (1/N) × Tr[I(θ)] quantifies semantic mass via information geometry
3. **Modular Zombie Test**: Falsification protocol comparing recurrent vs. feed-forward networks with identical input-output behavior

## Why It Matters

**AI Epistemology**: First empirical evidence that cross-architecture consensus emerges on theoretical physics questions, with implications for AI-assisted scientific discovery.

**Testable Science**: Gemini's Fisher information mass formula can be computed for any neural network today, enabling immediate experimental validation or falsification.

**Methodological Innovation**: Demonstrates systematic protocol for convergence studies applicable to open problems in physics, mathematics, and philosophy.

## What's Next

1. **Experimental validation** of Fisher information mass predictions
2. **Execution** of modular zombie test on real architectures
3. **Scaling** to 20-50 models to quantify convergence probability
4. **Publication** as arXiv preprint and submission to Nature Communications
