Although it was suggested that Mps1 regulates cell viability through its role in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), the underlying mechanism remains less defined. In an endeavor to reveal the role of high levels of mitotic kinase Mps1 in the development of colon cancer, we unexpectedly found the amount of Mps1 required for cell survival far exceeds that of maintaining SAC in aneuploid cell...",

KMT2A is a transcriptional co-activator regulating gene expression during early development and hematopoiesis, but the role of KMT2A in cervical cancer remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that KMT2A regulated cervical cancer growth via targeting VADC1. Knockdown of KMT2A significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migr",
