        "abstract": "Permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane is a key step in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, triggered by the release of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins into the cytoplasm. The BCL-2\u2013associated X apoptosis regulator (BAX) protein critically contributes to this process by forming pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, the relative roles of the mitochondrial residence of BAX and its oligomerization in promoting membrane permeabilization are unclear. To this end, u",

To investigate the mechanism of this apoptosis, we prepared transfectants expressing control (DT40-TRX2-/-), human thioredoxin 2 (TRX2) (DT40-hTRX2), or redox-inactive TRX2 (DT",
