INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTICE

The Epistemic Topology Framework (TYPE 0-3 Classification System) is the
core intellectual contribution of this project. This framework includes:

- Confidence ratio calculation methodology
- TYPE 0 (Crisis/Conditional): Ratio ~1.26, trigger-dependent logic
- TYPE 1 (Facts/Established): Ratio ~1.27, high-confidence knowledge
- TYPE 2 (Exploration/Novel): Ratio ~0.49, balanced exploration
- TYPE 3 (Speculation/Unknown): Ratio ~0.11, speculative territory

RESEARCH DISCLAIMER

IRIS Gate is research software for epistemic analysis of multi-model
convergence. Results should be interpreted with appropriate scientific
rigor:

- TYPE 1 claims are not "proven" - they represent high-confidence patterns
- TYPE 2 claims require verification before use in research
- TYPE 3 claims are speculative and require human expert judgment
- Verification via Perplexity does not constitute peer review

Always apply domain expertise and critical thinking to IRIS Gate outputs.

The Epistemic Topology Framework and associated confidence ratio
calculation methods may be subject to patent applications. Use of this
software under the Apache License 2.0 includes a patent grant as
